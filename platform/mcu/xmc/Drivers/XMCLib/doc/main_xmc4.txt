 *
 * The XMC Peripheral Library (XMC Lib) consists of low-level drivers for the XMC product family peripherals. <br> 
 * Built on top the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) and MISRA-C 2004 compliant, it provides access to all peripheral features. <br>
 *
 * @section support Supported devices and toolchains
 * The following 32-Bit Industrial Microcontrollers based on ARM Cortex-M4F are supported:
 * - XMC4800 series
 * - XMC4700 series
 * - XMC4500 series
 * - XMC4300 series
 * - XMC4400 series
 * - XMC4200 series
 * - XMC4100 series
 *
 * The following tool chains are supported:
 * - GNU GCC for ARM (gcc) found in Atollic TrueSTUDIO, DAVE and Rowley CrossWorks.
 * - Keil MDK-ARM Microcontroller Development Kit v5.x (armcc)
 * - IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM v7.x(iccarm)
 * - TASKING VX-toolset for ARM v5.(carm)
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 * XMC Lib consists of routines and data structures which covers all peripheral functions.
 *
 * It provides a peripheral register abstraction by a set of stateless APIs. It is possible to write a full application without a single peripheral register access.
 *
 * It is built on top of Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

 *
 * @section coding Coding Rules and Conventions
 * This section describes the set of coding rules and conventions applied to the XMC Peripheral Library:
 * - Strict C99 usage, in addtion unions and bitfields are used for more compact code and data section.
 * - Use only standard data types
 * - Use enumerations in favor of defines
 * - Naming convention: 
 *   - Variables use only lower case,underscore separated words.
 *   - Functions use CamelCase convention.
 * - Non blocking APIs for better integration in event driven applications. Polling is supported aswell by API.
 * - Runtime error checking can be enabled by user
 * - XMC_ASSERT() used to check input parameters of functions, result of calculations, ... . @note Only enabled if XMC_ASSERT_ENABLE macro is defined
 * - XMC_DEBUG() used to monitor status of application. @note Only enabled if XMC_DEBUG_ENABLE macro is defined
 * - Each driver defines its own namespace: every function and type definition is prefixed by a unique identifier, i.e. XMC_VADC
 *
 * XMC Peripheral Library follows an object oriented approach, where a instances of peripherals is treated as objects = attributes + functions.<br>
 * Attributes are the peripheral data structures defined in device header file. These gets configured using configuration data structures using initialization functions.<br>
 * Peripheral functions take a pointer to the peripheral data struct as the first argument.<br>
 * XMC Peripheral Library uses naming conventions to bind the data struct and the functions that operate on i, i.e. XMC_PERI_DoSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri, ...);
 *
 * Typically a driver contains the following functionality:
 * 1. Initialization function
 * @code
 * XMC_PERI_STATUS_t XMC_PERI_Init(XMC_PERI_t *const peri, const XMC_PERI_CONFIG_t const *config);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 2. Enable/disable peripheral functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Enable(XMC_PERI_t *const peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Disable(XMC_PERI_t *const peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 3. Connectivity functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_SetInputSource(XMC_PERI_t *const peri, ...);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 4. Event handling functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Enable(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Disable(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_EnableEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_DisableEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_TriggerEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * uint32_t XMC_PERI_GetEventStatus(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_SetInterruptNode(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 5. Control functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Start(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Stop(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Suspend(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Resume(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 6. Get/setters functions, run time API to obtain or modify state of peripheral
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_SetSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri, ...);
 * uint32_t XMC_PERI_GetSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 7. IRQ Handlers are provided which can be used optionally by the user to make easier the coding
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_IRQHandler(uint32_t sr_num);
 * @endcode
 *
 * A peripheral driver is structured as:
 * - Common API valid for all the supported devices, i.e. xmc_gpio.h and xmc_gpio.c
 * - Familiy specific extension API, i.e. xmc4_gpio.h and xmc4_gpio.c
 * - Maps files to help user to configure connectivity, i.e. xmc4_gpio_map.h already has defined all the pins available depending on the target device selected.
 *
 * If needed the family extension API implementation file, i.e. xmc4_gpio.c, can also overload common functionality to adapt it to target device.
 * The peripheral driver abstracts the target device, helping the user in code proting to another family or device.

 *
 * @section usage How to use the XMC Peripheral Library
 * The following steps are required:
 * 1. Include header file of required peripheral. No need to include device specific peripheral header files, 
      this is done automatically using the information of the selected target device.
 * 2. Peripheral configuration and initialization.
 * 3. Connectivity configuration.
 * 4. Event/interrupt configuration.
 * 5. Start operation.
 * 6. IO configuration.
 * 7. Manage peripheral.
 * 
 * @code
 * /* Include files */
 * #include <xmc_gpio.h>
 * #include <xmc_i2c.h>
 * ...
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *   /* Peripheral configuration and initialization. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_CONFIG_t i2c_cfg;
 *   i2c_cfg.baudrate = 400000U;
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_Init(XMC_I2C0_CH0, &i2c_cfg);
 *   
 *   /* Connectivity configuration. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_SetInputSource(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_INPUT_SDA, USIC1_C0_DX0_P2_14);
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_SetInputSource(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_INPUT_SCL, USIC1_C0_DX1_P5_8);
 *
 *   /* Event/interrupt configuration. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_EnableEvent(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_EVENT_ARBITRATION_LOST);
 *   NVIC_SetPriority(USIC0_0_IRQn, NVIC_GetPriorityGrouping(), 63, 0);
 *   NVIC_EnableIRQ(USIC0_0_IRQn);
 *
 *   /* Start operation. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_Start(XMC_I2C0_CH0);
 *
 *   /* IO configuration. */
 *   XMC_GPIO_SetMode(P1_5, XMC_GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN | P1_5_AF_U0C0_DOUT0);
 *   XMC_GPIO_SetMode(P1_1, XMC_GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN | P1_1_AF_U0C0_SCLKOUT);
 *   ...
 *   /* Manage peripheral */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_MasterStart(XMC_I2C1_CH0, IO_EXPANDER_ADDRESS, XMC_I2C_CH_CMD_WRITE);
 *   while((XMC_I2C_CH_GetStatusFlag(XMC_I2C1_CH0) & XMC_I2C_CH_STATUS_FLAG_ACK_RECEIVED) == 0U)
 *   {
 *   /* wait for ACK */

 * @section misrac MISRA-C 2004 Compliance Exceptions 
 * CMSIS-CORE violates the following MISRA-C:2004 rules:
 * - Required Rule 1.1, All code shall conform to ISO 9899:1990
 *   Compiler extensions are beyond IFX control
 * - Required Rule 1.4, The compiler/linker shall be checked to ensure that 31 character significance and case sensitivity are supported for external identifiers. and 5.1 : Variables can be named greater than 31 characters
 *   Long parameters names are defined for code readability. 
 * - Required Rule 5.1, Identifiers (internal and external) shall not rely on the significance of more than 31 characters.
 *   Long parameters names are defined for code readability. 
 * - Advisory Rule 5.7, No identifier name should be reused. 
 *   This rule is untenable.
 * - Advisory Rule 6.3, typedefs that indicate size and signedness should be used in place of the basic types
 *   Float data type used for signed-ness
 * - Required Rule 8.5, object/function definition in header file.
 *   Violated since function definitions in header files are used for function inlining'.
 * - Required Rule 11.2, Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to object and any type other than an integral type, another pointer to object type, or a pointer to void
 *   It may be sometimes necessary to cast a pointer to an integer and sometimes casting amongst pointers is unavoidable.
 * - Advisory Rule 11.3, A cast should not be performed between a pointer type and an integral type.
 *   It may be sometimes necessary to cast a pointer to an integer and sometimes casting amongst pointers is unavoidable.
 * - Advisory Rule 16.7, A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is not used to modify the addressed object 
 *   It is not mandatory to qualify all pointer arguments that are not going to be modified by callee function with a const attribute.
 * - Required Rule 18.4, declaration of union type or object of union type: '{...}'.
 *   Violated since unions are used for effective representation of core registers.
 * - Advisory Rule 19.4, Disallowed definition for macro.
 *   Violated since macros are used for assembler keywords.
 * - Advisory Rule 19.7, Function-like macro defined.
 *   Violated since function-like macros are used to generate more efficient code.
 * - Advisory Rule 20.2, Re-use of C90 identifier pattern.
 *   Violated since CMSIS macros begin with '__'. Since CMSIS is developed and verified with various compilers this approach is acceptable and avoids conflicts with user symbols.
 * - Advisory Rule 19.1, Declaration before \#include.
 *   Violated since Interrupt Number Definition Type (IRQn_Type) must be defined before including the core header file.
