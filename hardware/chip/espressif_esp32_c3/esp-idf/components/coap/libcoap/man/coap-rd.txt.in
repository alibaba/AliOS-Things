NAME
-----
coap-rd,
coap-rd-gnutls ,
coap-rd-mbedtls,
coap-rd-openssl,
coap-rd-notls - A CoAP Resource Directory based on libcoap

SYNOPSIS
--------
*coap-rd* [*-g* group] [*-G* group_if] [*-p* port] [*-v* num] [*-A* address]
          [[*-h* hint] [*-k* key]]
          [[*-c* certfile] [*-n*] [*-C* cafile] [*-R* trusted_casfile]]

For *coap-rd* versions that use libcoap compiled for different
(D)TLS libraries, *coap-rd-notls*, *coap-rd-gnutls*,
*coap-rd-openssl*, *coap-rd-mbedtls* or *coap-rd-tinydtls* may be
available.  Otherwise, *coap-rd* uses the default libcoap (D)TLS support.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*coap-rd* is a simple CoAP Resource Directory server that can handle resource
registrations using the protocol CoAP (RFC 7252).

OPTIONS
-------
*-g* group::
   Join specified multicast 'group' on startup.
   *Note:* DTLS over multicast is not currently supported.

*-G* group_if::
   Use this interface for listening for the multicast group. This can be
   different from the implied interface if the *-A* option is used.

*-p* port::
   The 'port' on the given address will be listening for incoming connections.
   If (D)TLS is supported, then 'port' + 1 will also be listened on for
   (D)TLS connections.
   The default port is 5683 if not given any other value.

*-v* num::
   The verbosity level to use (default: 3, maximum is 9). Above 7, there is
   increased verbosity in GnuTLS and OpenSSL logging.

*-A* address::
   The local address of the interface which the server has to listen on.

OPTIONS - PSK
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-h* hint::
   Identity Hint to send. Default is *CoAP*. Zero length is no hint.

*-k* key::
   Pre-shared key to use for inbound connections. This cannot be empty if
   defined.
   *Note:* if *-c cafile* is defined, you need to define *-k key* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

OPTIONS - PKI
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-c* certfile::
   Use the specified PEM file which contains the CERTIFICATE and PRIVATE
   KEY information.
   Note: if *-k key* is defined, you need to define *-c certfile* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-n* ::
  Disable remote peer certificate checking. This gives clients the ability to
  use PKI, but without any defined certificates.

*-C* cafile::
  PEM file that contains a list of one or more CAs that are to
  be passed to the client for the client to determine what client certificate
  to use.  Normally, this list of CAs would be the root CA and and any
  intermediate CAs. Ideally the server certificate should be signed by the
  same CA so that mutual authentication can take place. The contents of
  *cafile* are added to the trusted store of root CAs.  Using the *-C* or *-R*
  options will will trigger the validation of the client certificate unless
  overridden by the *-n* option.

*-R* trust_casfile::
  PEM file containing the set of trusted root CAs that are to be used to
  validate the client certificate. Alternatively, this can point to a
  directory containing a set of CA PEM files. The *-C cafile* CA does not have
  to be in this list and is trusted for the validation. Using
  *-R trust_casfile* disables common CA mutual authentication which can only
  be done by using *-C cafile*. Using the *-C* or *-R* options will will
  trigger the validation of the server certificate unless overridden by the
  *-n* option.

EXAMPLES
--------
* Example
----
coap-rd -A ::1
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port 5683).

* Example
----
coap-rd -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683' and '5684') with the server
set up for PSK authentication.

* Example
----
coap-rd -A ::1 -p 13011
----
Quite the same, except listening port is '13011' (and not the default port
5683).

* Example
----
coap-rd -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef  -v 5
----
The listening address is set to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and the
verbosity level is set to '5'.

* Example
----
coap-rd -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef  -g FF02::FD
----
Set listening address to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and join the
All CoAP Nodes multicast group 'FF02::FD'.

FILES
------
There are no configuration files.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   Success

*1*::
   Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; document
   processing failure; unexpected error)
