For *coap-server* versions that use libcoap compiled for different
(D)TLS libraries, *coap-server-notls*, *coap-server-gnutls*,
*coap-server-openssl*, *coap-server-mbedtls* or *coap-server-tinydtls* may be
available.  Otherwise, *coap-server* uses the default libcoap (D)TLS support.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*coap-server* is an example server for the 'Constrained Application Protocol`
(RFC 7252).

OPTIONS - General
-----------------
*-d* max::
   Enable support for creation of dynamic resources when doing a PUT up to a
   limit of 'max'.  If 'max' is reached, a 4.06 code is returned until one of
   the dynamic resources has been deleted.

*-e* ::
   Echo back the data sent with a PUT.

*-g* group::
   Join specified multicast 'group' on start up.
   *Note:* DTLS over multicast is not currently supported.

*-G* group_if::
   Use this interface for listening for the multicast group. This can be
   different from the implied interface if the *-A* option is used.

*-l* list::
   Fail to send some datagrams specified by a comma separated list of
   numbers or number ranges (debugging only).

*-l* loss%::
   Randomly failed to send datagrams with the specified probability - 100%
   all datagrams, 0% no datagrams (debugging only).

*-p* port::
   The 'port' on the given address will be listening for incoming connections.
   If (D)TLS is supported, then 'port' + 1 will also be listened on for
   (D)TLS connections.
   The default port is 5683 if not given any other value.

*-v* num::
   The verbosity level to use (default 3, maximum is 9). Above 7, there is
   increased verbosity in GnuTLS and OpenSSL logging.

*-A* address::
   The local address of the interface which the server has to listen on.

*-L* value::
   Sum of one or more COAP_BLOCK_* flag values for different block handling
   methods. Default is 1 (COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP).

     COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP  1
     COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY  2

*-N* ::
   Send NON-confirmable message for "observe" responses. If option *-N* is
   not specified, a confirmable response will be sent.  Even if set, every
   fifth response will still be sent as a confirmable response
   (RFC 7641 requirement).

*-P* scheme://address[:port],name1[,name2[,name3..]] ::
   Scheme, address, optional port of how to connect to the next proxy server
   and one or more names (comma separated) that this proxy server is known by.
   If the hostname of the incoming proxy request matches one of these names,
   then this server is considered to be the final endpoint. If
   scheme://address[:port] is not defined before the leading , (comma) of the
   first name, then the ongoing connection will be a direct connection.
   Scheme is one of coap, coaps, coap+tcp and coaps+tcp.


OPTIONS - PSK
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*-h* hint::
   Identity Hint to send. Default is *CoAP*. Zero length is no hint.

*-i* match_identiity_file::
   This is a file that contains one or more lines of Identity Hints and (user)
   Identities to match for a different new Pre-Shared Key (PSK) (comma
   separated) to be used. E.g., per line +
   hint_to_match,identity_to_match,use_key +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: *-k* still needs to be defined for the default case. +
   Note: A match using the *-s* option may mean that the current Identity Hint
   is different to that defined by *-h*.

*-k* key::
   Pre-shared key to use for inbound connections. This cannot be empty if
   defined. +
   Note: if *-c cafile* is defined, you need to define *-k key* as well to
   have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-s* match_psk_sni_file::
   This is a file that contains one or more lines of received Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match to use a different Identity Hint and associated
   Pre-Shared Key (PSK) (comma separated) instead of the *-h hint* and
   *-k key* options. E.g., per line +
   sni_to_match,use_hint,with_key +
   Note: *-k key* still needs to be defined for the default case if there is
   not a match. +
   Note: The associated Pre-Shared Key will get updated if there is also a *-i*
   match. The update checking order is *-s* followed by *-i*.

*-u* user ::
   User identity for pre-shared key mode (only used if option *-P* is set).

OPTIONS - PKI
-------------
(If supported by underlying (D)TLS library)

*Note:* If any one of *certfile*, *keyfile* or *cafile* is in PKCS11 URI
naming format (pkcs11: prefix), then any remaining non PKCS11 URI file
definitions have to be in DER, not PEM, format.  Otherwise all of
*certfile*, *keyfile* or *cafile* are in PEM format.

*-c* certfile::
  PEM file or PKCS11 URI for the certificate. The private key can also be in
  the PEM file, or has the same PKCS11 URI. If not, the private key is defined
  by *-j keyfile*. +
  Note: if *-k key* is defined, you need to define *-c certfile* as well to
  have the server support both PSK and PKI.

*-j* keyfile::
  PEM file or PKCS11 URI for the private key for the certificate in *-c
  certfile* if the parameter is different from certfile in *-c certfile*.

*-n* ::
  Disable remote peer certificate checking. This gives clients the ability to
  use PKI, but without any defined certificates.

*-C* cafile::
  PEM file or PKCS11 URI that contains a list of one or more CAs that are to
  be passed to the client for the client to determine what client certificate
  to use.  Normally, this list of CAs would be the root CA and and any
  intermediate CAs. Ideally the server certificate should be signed by the
  same CA so that mutual authentication can take place. The contents of
  *cafile* are added to the trusted store of root CAs.  Using the *-C* or *-R*
  options will will trigger the validation of the client certificate unless
  overridden by the *-n* option.

*-J* pkcs11_pin::
   The user pin to unlock access to the PKCS11 token.

*-M*::
  Raw Public Key (RPK) PEM file or PKCS11 URI that contains both PUBLIC KEY
  and PRIVATE KEY or just EC PRIVATE KEY. (GnuTLS and TinyDTLS(PEM) support
  only).  *-C cafile* or *-R trust_casfile* are not required.

*-R* trust_casfile::
  PEM file containing the set of trusted root CAs that are to be used to
  validate the client certificate. Alternatively, this can point to a
  directory containing a set of CA PEM files. The *-C cafile* CA does not have
  to be in this list and is trusted for the validation. Using
  *-R trust_casfile* disables common CA mutual authentication which can only
  be done by using *-C cafile*. Using the *-C* or *-R* options will will
  trigger the validation of the server certificate unless overridden by the
  *-n* option.

*-S* match_pki_sni_file::
   This option denotes a file that contains one or more lines of Subject Name
   Identifier (SNI) to match for new certificate File and new CA File (comma
   separated) to be used. E.g., entry per line +
   sni_to_match,new_cert_file,new_ca_file +
   A line that starts with # is treated as a comment. +
   Note: *-c certfile* and *-C cafile* still needs to be defined for the
   default case

EXAMPLES
--------
* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683') for UDP/TCP.

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint
----
Let the server listen on localhost (port '5683' for UDP/TCP and port '5684' for
DTLS/TLS) with the server set up for PSK authentication if the client uses
coaps:// or coaps+tcp://.

* Example
----
coap-server -A ::1 -k mysecretKey -h myhint -p 13011
----
The same, except the UDP/TCP listening port is '13011' and the DTLS/TLS
listening port is '13012' (and not the default ports '5683' and '5684').

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -v 5
----
The listening address is set to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and the
verbosity level is set to '5'.

* Example
----
coap-server -A 2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef -g FF02::FD
----
Set listening address to '2001:db8:81a8:0:6ef0:dead:feed:beef' and join the
All CoAP Nodes multicast group 'FF02::FD'.

FILES
------
There are no configuration files.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
   Success

*1*::
   Failure (syntax or usage error; configuration error; document
   processing failure; unexpected error)
