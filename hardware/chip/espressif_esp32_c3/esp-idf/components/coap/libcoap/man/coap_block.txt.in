DESCRIPTION
-----------
Regular setting up of a PDU and transmission is covered in *coap_pdu_setup*(3)
where all the payload data can fit in a single packet.  This man page covers
how to work with PDUs where the overall body of information may need to be
split across several packets by using CoAP Block-Wise Transfers (RFC 7959).

The block-wise transfers can be controlled by the application, or libcoap is
instructed to do all the requests for the next blocks and only present the
final body of the result to the application.  In summary, the following three
ways handle processing a body of data that has to be split across multiple
payloads (blocks).

1. Application does all the work +
It is the responsibility of the application to analyze each block transmission
at receipt and then generate the next request as per RFC 7959.  In this case,
*coap_context_set_block_mode*() function MUST NOT be called to maintain
backward compatability with applications that did the block handling within the
application.

2. Application sees individual blocks +
By calling *coap_context_set_block_mode(context, COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP)* and
using the appropriate functions, the requests for the next block of data is
handled automatically by the libcoap layer.  Each individual block of data is
presented to the application for processing. +
By calling *coap_get_data_large*(), the application can determine if this is
the first block or not (using _offset_ value), whether the first block is all
the data (_offset_ = 0, _length_ = _total_) and whether this is the last block
(_offset_ + _length_ = _total_). It is the responsibility of the application to
re-assemble the individual blocks into a single body of data. +
*NOTE:* _total_ is only an approximation (it will be > _offset_ + _length_)
until the final block is received. +
If this is the request handler in a server, the server still needs to return a
COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CONTINUE 2.31 (Continue) response code if the received data
is not for the final block, otherwise a COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CREATED 2.01
(Created) or COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CHANGED 2.04 (Changed) should be returned.

3. Application only sees all of the body +
By calling *coap_context_set_block_mode(context,
COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP|COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY)* and using the appropriate
functions, the requests for all the blocks of data is handled automatically by
the libcoap layer.  Only the complete body of the data is presented to the
application, unless there is an error. +
*coap_get_data_large*() will only return the entire body of data (_offset_
always 0, _length_ = _total_) and there is no need to re-assemble individual
blocks into a large body of data. +
In RAM constrained environments, option 2 may be the preferred method.

This man page focuses on getting libcoap to do all the work, not how to do it
all in the application.

However, if the client supplies a BLOCK1 or BLOCK2 Option in the PDU where the
block number is not 0, this is assumed to be a random access request and any
other blocks will not be requested by libcoap even if instructed otherwise.

The functions that are named *_large* are intended as replacements for the
equivalent functions as described in *coap_pdu_setup*(3).

The *coap_context_set_block_mode*() function is used to set up the _context_
level _block_mode_ block handling bits for supporting RFC7959. _block_mode_
flows down to a session when a session is created and if the peer does not
support the respective block mode, an appropriate bit may get disabled in the
session _block_mode_.

----
#define COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP  0x01 /* Use libcoap to do block requests */
#define COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY  0x02 /* Deliver the data as a single body */
----
_block_mode_ is an or'd set of zero or more COAP_BLOCK_* definitions.

If COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY is set, then the entire body of data is presented to
the receiving handler, otherwise each individual block is presented on arrival.
To obtain the data, length and current offset, *coap_get_data_large*() must
be used instead of *coap_get_data*().  It may be appropriate not to set
COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY if there are RAM limitations.

*NOTE:* It is the responsibility of the receiving application to re-assemble
the _data_ as appropriate (e.g., using *coap_block_build_body*()) if
COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY is not set.

*NOTE:* If COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY is not set, then the CoAP server on receiving
request data that is split over multiple data blocks must respond with
COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CONTINUE 2.31 (Continue) response code if the received data
is not for the final block, otherwise a COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CREATED 2.01
(Created) or COAP_RESPONSE_CODE_CHANGED 2.04 (Changed) should be returned.

If COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP is set, then any PDUs presented to the application
handlers will get the tokens set back to the initiating token so that requests
can be matched with responses even if different tokens had to be used for the
series of packet interchanges.  Furthermore, if COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY is set,
then the PDU that presents the entire body will have any BLOCKx option removed.

*NOTE:* COAP_BLOCK_USE_LIBCOAP must be set if libcoap is to do all the
block tracking and requesting, otherwise the application will have to do all
of this work (the default if *coap_context_set_block_mode*() is not called).

typedef void (*coap_release_large_data_t)(coap_session_t *session,

----

The *coap_add_data_large_request*() function is similar to *coap_add_data*(),
but supports the transmission of data that has a body size that is potentially
larger than can be fitted into a single client request PDU. The specified
payload _data_ of length _length_ is associated with the _session_ with the
first block of data added to the PDU _pdu_ along with the appropriate CoAP
options such as BLOCK1, and SIZE1 if the data does not fit in
a single PDU.  When the block has been acknowledged by the peer, the library
will then send the next block of data until all the data has been transmitted.
This function must only be called once per _pdu_.  The _data_ passed to the
function *coap_add_data_large_request*() must exist until all blocks have been
transmitted. The callback function _release_func_ can be used to release
storage that has been dynamically allocated to hold the transmit data. If not
NULL, the callback function is called once the final block of _data_ has been
transmitted. The user-defined parameter _app_ptr_ is the same value that was
passed to *coap_add_data_large_request*().

The *coap_add_data_large_response*() function is responsible for handling
the server's large responses to requests. *coap_add_data_large_response*()
should be used as a direct replacement for *coap_add_data*() if it is possible
that the _length_ of _data_ will not fit in a single server's response pdu.
This function adds in the initial part of the payload _data_ of length
_length_ to the PDU _pdu_. The _data_ passed to the function
*coap_add_data_large_response*() must exist until all blocks have been
transmitted. The callback function _release_func_ can be used to release
storage that has been dynamically allocated to hold the transmit data. If not
NULL, the callback function is called once the final block of _data_ has been
transmitted. The user-defined parameter _app_ptr_ is the same value that was
passed to *coap_add_data_large_response*().

It also adds in the appropriate CoAP options such as BLOCK2, SIZE2 and ETAG to
handle block-wise transfer if the data does not fit in a single PDU.
_resource_, _query_, _session_, _request_, and _response_ are the same
parameters as in the called resource handler that invokes
*coap_add_data_large_response*(). If _etag_ is 0, then a unique ETag value will
be generated, else is the ETag value to use.
The _media_type_ is for the format of the _data_ and _maxage_ defines the
lifetime of the response.  If _maxage_ is set to -1,  then the MAXAGE option
does not get included (which indicates the default value of 60 seconds
according to RFC 7252). This function must only be called once per _pdu_.
The application handler for the resource is only called once instead of
potentially multiple times.

The *coap_get_data_large*() function is used abstract from the _pdu_
information about the received data by updating _length_ with the length of
data available, _data_ with a pointer to where the data is located, _offset_
with where this block of data starts and _total_ with the total amount of data.
_offset_ will always be zero if block_mode includes COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY.
All of the body's data has been received if "_offset_ + _length_ == _total_".

*NOTE:* _total_ is potentially only an indication of the total size of the
body and is only exact when all of the data has been received.

The *coap_block_build_body*() function is used to re-assemble the received
data as returned by *coap_get_data_large*() into a single blob of data. Data
from _data_ of length _length_ starting from offset _offset_ is added to
_body_data_.  The resultant state of _body_data_ is returned. If _body_data_
is NULL, or _total_ is larger than the current size of _body_data_, then
_body_data_ is re-allocated and returned.  If there is an error, _body_data_
gets de-allocated.

If _block_mode_ (as set by *coap_context_set_block_mode*()) includes
COAP_BLOCK_SINGLE_BODY, then the response handler will only get called
once with the entire body containing the data from all of the individual
blocks. If there is a change of data during the blocks receipt (e.g., ETag
value changes), then the entire set of data is re-requested and the partial
body dropped.

RETURN VALUES
-------------
The *coap_add_data_large_request*(), *coap_add_data_large_response*(), and
*coap_get_data_large*() functions return 0 on failure, 1 on success.

The  *coap_block_build_body*() returns the current state of the body's data
(which may have some missing gaps) or NULL on error.
