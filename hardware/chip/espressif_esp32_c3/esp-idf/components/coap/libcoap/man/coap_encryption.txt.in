- Work with CoAP TLS/DTLS

SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <coap@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@/coap.h>*

*struct coap_dtls_cpsk_t;*

*struct coap_dtls_spsk_t;*

*struct coap_dtls_pki_t;*

For specific (D)TLS library support, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-notls*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-gnutls*,
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-openssl*, *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-mbedtls*
or *-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@-tinydtls*.   Otherwise, link with
*-lcoap-@LIBCOAP_API_VERSION@* to get the default (D)TLS library support.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This man page focuses on setting up CoAP to use encryption.

When the libcoap library was built, it will have been compiled using a
specific underlying TLS implementation type (e.g. OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Mbed TLS,
TinyDTLS or noTLS).
When the libcoap library is linked into an application, it is possible
that the application needs to dynamically determine whether DTLS or TLS is
supported, what type of TLS implementation libcoap was compiled with, as well
as detect what is the version of the currently loaded TLS library.

*NOTE:* If OpenSSL is being used, then the minimum supported OpenSSL library
version is 1.1.0.

*NOTE:* If GnuTLS is being used, then the minimum GnuTLS library version is
3.3.0.

*NOTE:* If Mbed TLS is being used, then the minimum Mbed TLS library version is
2.7.10.

*NOTE:* If GnuTLS is going to interoperate with TinyDTLS, then a minimum
revision of GnuTLS 3.5.5 which supports CCM algorithms is required
by TinyDTLS as TinyDTLS currently only supports CCM.

*NOTE:* For Raw Public Key support, GnuTLS library version must be 3.6.6 or
later. TinyDTLS only supports TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8, curve
secp256r1 and hash SHA-256.  There currently is no OpenSSL or Mbed TLS RPK support
(respective library limitations).

Network traffic can be un-encrypted or encrypted with libcoap if there is an
underlying TLS library.

If TLS is going to be used for encrypting the network traffic, then the TLS
information for Pre-Shared Keys (PSK), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or
Raw Public Key (RPK) needs to be configured before any network traffic starts
to flow. For Servers, this has to be done before the Endpoint is created,
for Clients, this is done during the Client Session set up.

For Servers, all the encryption information is held internally by the TLS
Context level and the CoAP Context level as the Server is listening for new
incoming traffic based on the Endpoint definition.  The TLS and CoAP session
will not get built until the new traffic starts, which is done by the libcoap
library, with the session having a reference count of 1.

For Clients, all the encryption information will be held internally by the TLS
Context and/or TLS Session level and internally by the CoAP Session level.

In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Servers looks like
----
coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_context_set_pki() and/or coap_context_set_psk2() - if encryption is required
coap_new_endpoint()
----

Multiple endpoints can be set up per Context, each listening for a new traffic
flow with different TCP/UDP protocols, TLS protocols, port numbers etc. When a
new traffic flow is started, then the CoAP library will create and start a new
server session.

In principle the set-up sequence for CoAP Clients looks like
----
coap_new_context()
coap_context_set_pki_root_cas() - if the root CAs need to be updated and PKI
coap_new_client_session(), coap_new_client_session_pki() or coap_new_client_session_psk2()
----

Multiple client sessions are supported per Context.

Due to the nature of TLS, there are Callbacks that are invoked as the TLS
session negotiates encryption algorithms, encryption keys etc.
Where possible, the CoAP layer handles all this automatically based on
different configuration options passed in by the coap_context_set_pki(),
coap_new_client_session_pki(), coap_context_set_psk2() and
coap_new_client_session_psk2() functions.

PSK CLIENT INFORMATION
----------------------

For Client PSK setup, the required information needs to be provided in the setup
calls with optional application callbacks defined to update the Identity and
PSK. Initially, the Client has to provide an Identity and a Pre-Shared Key.

Libcoap will put the Identity and Pre-Shared Key as appropriate into the TLS
environment.

*validate_ih_call_back* points to an application provided Identity Hint callback
function or NULL. The application can make use of this Identity Hint information
to decide what Identity and Pre-Shared Key should be used for this session.
The Callback returns the new coap_dtls_cpsk_info_t on success,
or NULL if the Identity Hint is unacceptable.

*NOTE:* The Server may not provide a hint, or a zero length hint to indicate
there is no hint.  In this case the initially provided Identity and
Pre-Shared Key should be used.

*ih_call_back_arg* points to a user defined set of data that will get passed
in to the validate_ih_call_back() function's arg parameter and can be used by
that function.  An example would be a set of Identity Hints that map into new
Identity / Pre-Shared Key to use.

*SECTION: PSK Client: coap_dtls_cpsk_t: Subject Name Indicator (SNI) Definition*

*client_sni* points to the SNI name that will be added in as a TLS extension,
if not NULL.  This typically is the DNS name of the server that the client is
trying to contact.  The server is then able to decide, based on the name in the
SNI extension, whether, for example, a different Hint and/or Pre-Shared Key is
to be used.

validate_id_call_back() needs to be sure that the appropriate Pre-Shared Key
is provided.

*validate_id_call_back* points to an application provided Identity callback

The Callback returns the new coap_bin_const_t Pre-Shared Key on success,

*NOTE:* The Client may be using a binary Identity that contains an embedded
zero. However OpenSSL and GnuTLS do not currently support this.

*id_call_back_arg* points to a user defined set of data that will get passed

*validate_sni_call_back* points to an application provided SNI callback
checking function or NULL. The application can make use of this SNI information
to decide whether the SNI is valid, and hence what new Hint and Pre-Shared Key
to use.
Thus it is possible for the coap server to host multiple domains with
different Hints and PSKs allocated to each SNI domain.
The Callback returns a coap_dtls_spsk_info_t pointer to the Hint and
Pre-Shared Key to use for this SNI, or NULL if the connection is to get
rejected.  Libcoap remembers the association between a specific SNI and Hint +
Pre-Shared Key set and will only invoke this callback if the SNI is unknown.

Note: Not supported by TinyDTLS.

*sni_call_back_arg* points to a user defined set of data that will get passed
in to the validate_sni_call_back() function and can be used by that function.

PKI/RPK CLIENT AND SERVER INFORMATION
-------------------------------------

For PKI or RPK setup, if the libcoap PKI/RPK configuration options do not
handle a specific requirement as defined by the available options, then an
application defined Callback can called to do the additional specific checks.

The information passed to this Application Callback will be the
TLS session (as well the configuration information), but the structures
containing this information will be different as they will be based on the
underlying TLS library type. coap_get_tls_library_version() is provided to help
here.

Libcoap will add in the defined Certificate (or Public Key), Private Key and
CA Certificate into the TLS environment.  The CA Certificate is also added
in to the list of valid CAs for Certificate checking.

The internal Callbacks (and optionally the Application Callback) will then
check the required information as defined in the coap_dtls_pki_t described
below.

checking function or NULL. The application can make use of this SNI information
to decide whether the SNI is valid, and what set of certificates to give to the

different certificates allocated to each domain.
The Callback returns a pointer to the certificates to use for this SNI, or NULL
if the connection it to get rejected.  libcoap remembers the association
between the SNI and Certificate set and will only invoke this callback if the
SNI is unknown.

public certificate defined by *key.pkcs11.public_cert* or NULL.

*key.pkcs11.user_pin* is the user pin used to unlock the token or NULL.
