 * Here's something you've all been waiting for:  the AT&T public domain
 * source for getopt(3).  It is the code which was given out at the 1985
 * UNIFORUM conference in Dallas.  I obtained it by electronic mail
 * directly from AT&T.  The people there assure me that it is indeed
 * in the public domain.
