To build the libcoap libraries, you need to do the following

Unpack the distribution package file
Change into the top level directory of the unpackaged files

TinyDTLS Only
=============

It is possible that you may need to execute the following two commands once to
get the TinyDTLS code into your project, so the TinyDTLS library can be used.

git submodule init
git submodule update

General Building (not for LwIP or Contiki - see below)
================

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

./autogen.sh will fail if there is a required package for buildling libcoap
that is missing. Install the missing package and try ./autogen.sh again.

It is possible that you may need to provide some options to ./configure
to customize your installation.

In particular you may need to define which (D)TLS ligrary to use as well as
disable some building of documentation.

General configure instructions can be found in INSTALL, which is built
by ./autogen.sh

./configure --help
gives the specific options available to libcoap.

Some examples are:-

# No DTLS
./configure --enable-tests --disable-documentation --enable-examples --disable-dtls --enable-shared

# With TinyDTLS
./configure --enable-tests --disable-documentation --enable-examples --with-tinydtls --enable-shared

Note: FreeBSD requires gmake instead of make when building TinyDTLS - i.e.
gmake
sudo gmake install

# With OpenSSL
./configure --with-openssl --enable-tests --enable-shared

# With GnuTLS
./configure --with-gnutls --enable-tests --enable-shared

Note: --disable-documentation disables the building of doxygen and man page
files.  If you want to only disable one of them, use --disable-doxygen or
--disable-manpages.  Doxygen requires the program doxygen and man pages require
the program a2x to build the appropriate files.

If you need to rebuild the libcoap-*.{map,sym} files to update any exposed
function changes, run

make update-map-file

prior to running 'make'.

LwIP
====

./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-tests --disable-documentation --disable-examples --disable-dtls
cd examples/lwip
make

Executable is ./server. See examples/lwip/README for further information

Contiki
=======

./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-tests --disable-documentation --disable-examples --disable-dtls
cd examples/contiki
make

Executable is ./server.minimal-net. See examples/contiki/README for further information
