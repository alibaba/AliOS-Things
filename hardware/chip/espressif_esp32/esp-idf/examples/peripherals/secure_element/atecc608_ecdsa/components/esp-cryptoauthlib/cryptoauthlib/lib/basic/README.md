basic directory - Purpose
=========================
The purpose of this directory is to contain the files implementing the APIs for
a basic interface to the core CryptoAuthLib library.

High-level functions like these make it very convenient to use the library when
standard configurations and defaults are in play.  They are the easiest to use
when developing examples or trying to understand the "flow" of an
authentication operation without getting overwhelmed by the details.

This makes simple jobs easy and if you need more sophistication and power, you
can employ the full power of the CryptoAuthLib object model.

See the Doxygen documentation in cryptoauthlib/docs for details on the API of
the Basic commands.
