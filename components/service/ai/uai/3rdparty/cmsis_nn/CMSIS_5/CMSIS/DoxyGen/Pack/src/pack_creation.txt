\page cp_Packs Overview

The <b>CMSIS-Pack</b> format is used to deliver a software package and is aimed to be scalable for future requirements.
It provides a management process and supports a tool independent distribution for:

 - \ref createPack_DFP "Device Support" for tool chains and software applications to target a specific device:
  - Information about the processor and it's features.
  - C and assembly files for the device startup and access to the memory mapped peripheral registers.
  - Parameters, technical information, and data sheets about the device family and the specific devices.
  - Device description and available peripherals.
  - Memory layout of internal and external RAM and ROM address ranges.
  - \ref flashAlgorithm "Flash algorithms" for programming the device.
  - Debug and trace configurations as well as System View Description files for device specific display of the memory mapped
    peripheral registers.

 - \ref createPackBoard "Board Support" for rapid development in the prototyping stage:
  - Information about the development board and it's features.
  - Parameters, technical information, and data sheets about the board, the mounted microcontroller and peripheral devices.
  - Drivers for on-board peripheral devices

 - \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Components" simplify the re-use of software and the management of 3rd party software. They contain:
  - A collection of source modules, header and \ref configWizard "configuration files" as well as libraries.
  - Documentation of the software, including features and APIs.
  
 - \ref cp_API "Application Programming Interfaces" specify one or more APIs for \ref cp_Components "software components" that are
   part of another \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".

 - \ref cp_Examples can be used as a reference and starting point for similar applications. They contain:
  - Fully defined application projects that work out of the box in the specified build and debug environments.
  - Documentation about the purpose of the example, how to build, configure and execute the application.
  
 - \ref cp_CodeTemplates help to understand the basic concepts of a software component better and to give the user a
   good starting point for implementing his application. 


\section cp_Components Software Components

A software component encapsulates a set of related functions. Software components can contain C/C++ source files, object code,
assembler files, header files, or libraries. The interfaces of software components should be defined with \ref cp_API "API
headers" to make them substitutable by other compatible components at design time. In addition, CMSIS software components
should contain documentation for the software component. They may provide user code templates that give a starting point for
the application developer, and can have optional debug view descriptions for debuggers. 

CMSIS software components can also refer to multiple interfaces of other software components. This could be also a hardware
abstraction layer for a device peripheral. 

Configuration files contain application specific parameters for a software component. These files are typically copied to the
user project workspace; all other files are not modified by the user and can remain in a separate location which avoids that
a project workspace is polluted by many source files that should be considered as “black-box” elements by the application
programmer.

\anchor cp_CompDetails
Technical Details
-----------------

A component lists the files that belong to it and that are relevant for a project. The component itself or each individual
file may refer to a \ref element_condition "condition" that must resolve to true; if it is false, the component or file is
not applicable in the given context.

Each software component must have the following attributes that are used to identify the component:
  - Component Class (\c Cclass): A component class which is a top-level component name, for example \b CMSIS, \b Device,
    \b File \b System
  - Component Group (\c Cgroup): A component group name, for example \b CMSIS:RTOS, \b Device:Startup, \b File \b System:CORE
  - Component Version (\c Cversion): the version number of the software component.

Optionally, a software component may have additional attributes:
  - Component Sub-Group (\c Csub): A component sub-group that is used when multiple compatible implementations of a component
    are be available. For example \b CMSIS:RTOS:MyRTOS, \b Device:Driver \b USBD:Full-speed
  - Component Variant (\c Cvariant): A variant of the software component is typically used when the same implementation has
    multiple top-level configurations, like debug and release.
  - Component Vendor (\c Cvendor): the supplier of the software component.
  - Cbundle: allows to combine multiple software components into a software bundle. For example if a network stack is used,
    all interfaces must match to that component.
  - Instances: allow to deploy multiple instances of a software component. Each instance can have a separate configuration
    file.


The \c Cclass, \c Cgroup, \c Csub, \c Cvariant and \c Cversion attributes are used together with the vendor specified by the
pack to identify a component. A component vendor must ensure that the combination \c Cclass, \c Cgroup, \c Csub and
\c Cversion is unique and not used by multiple components within the same Pack. Advertise a set of attributes to be used by
other software components using the \ref element_taxonomy.

For a list of established Cclasses, refer to \ref pack_Cclass.

In case multiple interdependent components (belonging to the same \c Cclass) form part of a solution, these can be grouped
in a so called \ref cp_Bundles "bundle". 

Use the following syntax to reference to software components and APIs:\n
<b>\<Vendor\>::\<Cclass\>:\<Cgroup\>:\<Csub\></b>
  
\b Examples:
  - <b>\::CMSIS:RTOS (API)</b> - the CMSIS-RTOS API.
  - <b>ARM::CMSIS:DSP</b> - the CMSIS-DSP Library.
  - <b>\::File System:Drive:NOR</b> - the NOR Flash Drive of a file system.

Here is an example for the display of software components in a development tool:

\image html ComponentDisplay.png "Display of a software component in development tools"

Software Component Files
------------------------
Each software component consists of a certain number of files. Each file has at least the following attributes:
- \c name: File path, file name, and file extension in the format path/name.extension. The file path is relative to the root
  directory of the Pack. 
- \c category: Defines the purpose of the file. Select the predefined value as listed in the table
  \ref FileCategoryEnum "File Categories".

Optionally, every file may have the following attributes:
- \c attr: Defines the special use and handling of a file. Select a predefined value as defined in the table
  \ref FileAttributeEnum "File Attributes".
- \c condition: Enter the identifier (attribute \em <b>id</b>) of a \ref element_condition "condition". The element is used
  if the condition resolves to \token{true}.
- \c select: Brief description and purpose of the file. The \b <em>select</em> attribute is \b required when \b <em>attr</em>
  is set to \token{template} or \token{interface}. When multiple template files of a component have the same
  \b <em>select</em> string, they are treated as a single selectable template. This way, multiple template or interface files
  can be bundled.
- \c src: Path information. The path is specified relative to the Pack Description File (PDSC).
- \c version: File-specific version information. This is used particularly for files copied into the project workspace.
  Before a file gets copied, a version check avoids unnecessary copy actions. If a file does not have a version, then the
  component version is used.


\section cp_Cond References to other software components

Software components can reference other software components (either within the same pack or in other packs) using conditions:

\image html conditions.png

A condition describes dependencies on:
- a specific device
- a certain processor
- tool attributes
- the presence of other components (pcak internal or external)

Conditions can be used to ensure that specific software components are either present in the system or can prevent that
illegal combinations of software components are chosen by the user.

Conditions are used to define <b>AND/OR</b> rules that make components conditional and therefore only available under
certain circumstances, for example for specific devices or processors. Conditions are also used to express dependencies
between software components.

Each condition has an <b>id</b> that is unique within the scope of a the PDSC file. An id can be referenced in the
\c condition attribute of components, APIs, examples, files and other conditions.
All attributes set in a <b>accept</b>, <b>require</b>, or <b>deny</b> element must resolve to true for the element to become
true. A condition becomes true when:
- At least one <b>accept</b> element is true, \a AND
- all <b>require</b> elements are true, \a AND
- no <b>deny</b> element is true.

If a condition resolves to false during processing, the respective element will be ignored.


\section cp_Requirements Requirements

Packs can require other packs to be available (and can even ask for a specific version of a pack):

\image html requirements.png

There are three different requirement types:
- The \c packages section lists CMSIS Packs that have been used to configure the project. This includes the specification of
  a version range to ensure compatibility. If no version is provided, the latest installed version is used. If not yet
  installed, the latest available version will be installed before resolving the configuration.
- The \c compilers section specifies the toolchains that are supported by this example. The required compiler version is
  specified using the version element. If no compiler is specified, it is assumed that any toolchain will work.
- The \c languages section allows to specify requirements regarding the programming language, for example C99 standard. If no
  language requirements are set, ANSI C is assumed.


\section cp_APIDef Central API definition

The CMSIS-Pack system allows a central API definition that shares header file information and documentation of an
\ref element_api "API interface".

\image html api.png

This single API interface definition ensures consistency when it is used across multiple implementations that consume the
interface. The API interface definition can be distributed separately or as part of the software component that consumes this
interface. 

An example is the \b CMSIS-Driver pack that contains various hardware interface drivers that all compatible with the
CMSIS-Driver APIs (that are published in the CMSIS Pack).


\section cp_RTECompH Inventory header file: RTE_Components.h

Frequently, the behavior or features of a software component depend on the presence of other software components in the
application. For example, a network stack can interface to Ethernet or serial PPP (UART). Depending on the presence of
interface components, the implementation may behave differently.

To simplify application configuration, the file \b RTE_Components.h is generated before the project build step. It contains
the inventory of all selected components. For each selected software component, it contains \#define statements that are
specified by the component meta data. The following example shows an RTE_Components.h file:

\code
/* 
   Auto generated Run-Time-Environment Component Configuration File 
        *** Do not modify ! *** 
 */ 

#ifndef RTE_COMPONENTS_H 
#define RTE_COMPONENTS_H 

/* 
   Define the Device Header File: 
 */ 

#define CMSIS_device_header "stm32f10x.h" 

#define RTE_Network_Interface_ETH_0     /* Network Interface ETH 0 */ 
#define RTE_Network_Socket_BSD          /* Network Socket BSD */ 
#define RTE_Network_Socket_TCP          /* Network Socket TCP */ 
#define RTE_Network_Socket_UDP          /* Network Socket UDP */ 

#endif /* RTE_COMPONENTS_H */
\endcode

Use this information in other header files to control features that depend on the inclusion to other software components. For
example:

\code
#include "RTE_Components.h" 
#ifdef  RTE_Network_Interface_ETH_0  // if component is included 
#include "Net_Config_ETH_0.h"        // add related configuration file 
#endif
\endcode


\section cp_Combine Combining software components

When using software components, you can use the conditions to automatically resolve dependencies on other components. Use
this to combine components for a project in a certain way, while combining them differently for another project. In the
following example, a network stack transfers data via Ethernet. The network stack requires a MAC and PHY to do this. The
selected device from silicon vendor A that contains an on-chip MAC, thus only requiring a PHY to be selected:

\image html internal_mac_example.png "Example with internal MAC"

You can copy the project, select a different device from silicon vendor B for example and let the run-time environment
manager do the exchange of the components. As the new devices do not have an on-chip MAC, you need to select a different
component to fulfill the requirement for the network stack:

\image html external_mac_example.png "Example with external MAC and PHY"

This reduces the development time drastically, as the developer does not need to care for the correct dependency between
software components, but can concentrate on the implementation of his own application code.


\section cp_PackSteps Steps to Create a Pack

The following image shows the basic steps that are required to create a Software Pack:

\image html PackCreateSteps.png

-# <b>Produce input:</b> Create the files that will be delivered with the Pack.
-# <b>Organize files:</b> Use directories to separate the content of the Pack.
-# <b>Create PDSC file:</b> The XML based PDSC file can be created using any text editor. Editors that can
   validate XML code against a schema file help to find bugs early in the Pack development stage.
-# <b>Generate Pack:</b> Any compression tool supporting the ZIP format can be used to create a Pack file. \ref packChk is
   helpful for the validation of the contents of a Pack.

The following pages will show how to create a Software Pack from scratch. The page \ref cp_SWComponents will start with a simple
Pack containing only the PDSC file and a single software component and will then explain further elements of a Pack in more detail.
The page \ref createPack_DFP adds information on the additional requirements that a DFP has, while \ref createPackBoard will
elaborate on the content specific to a BSP.


\section PackTutorials Pack Tutorial

The <b>ARM::CMSIS</b> Pack contains tutorials that are explained on the following pages. In the \b \\CMSIS\\Pack\\Tutorials
directory the following three ZIP files are available:
|ZIP File                           |Documentation        
|-----------------------------------|---------------------
|Pack_with_Software_Components.zip  | \ref cp_SWComponents
|Pack_with_Device_Support.zip       | \ref createPack_DFP
|Pack_with_Board_Support.zip        | \ref createPackBoard


\section PackFilenames Pack Conventions

A \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" is a collection of files located in directories that are archived in a file with the extension *.pack using the standard
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">ZIP file format</a>.
The Pack Description file (PDSC) with the file extension *.pdsc contains the \ref packFormat "meta information", describing the content of a pack based on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank">XML</a>. The PDSC file must be:
- included in the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack"
- located in the base folder of the archive
- compliant with the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" file \ref pack_filename "naming convention"

\note
- The <em>base folder</em> is defined to be the root folder './' of a zip archive and it is imperative that the whole
  \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" only contains a single PDSC file.
- Future tools shall support this case: if the PDSC file is located in an immediate subdirectory, then the subdirectory
  becomes the base folder. The \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" is installed as if the subdirectory does not exist. All
  files and directories located in the root folder are ignored and do not get installed.

\subsection pack_filename Pack File Name

A \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" must have a unique filename. Therefore it is constructed from vendor, packname and version and the file extension *.pack.

<b>\<vendor\>.\<name\>.\<version\>.pack</b>.

Where:
 - <b>\<vendor\></b> is the name of the supplier or vendor of the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".
 - <b>\<name\></b> is the name of the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack". All packs that are published by a vendor must have a unique pack name.
 - <b>\<release version="X.Y.Z"\></b>specifies the \ref VersionType "version number" of the release for the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".
 - <b>.pack</b> is the file extension identifying a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".

\note
- The XML elements \elem{vendor}, \elem{name}, and the version attribute of the \elem{release} are specified in the \ref Filenames "PDSC" file. 
  PDSC, Pack filenames are case sensitive and need to match exactly.
- \elem{vendor} and \elem{name} \em must \em not contain spaces.
- The PDSC file needs to reside in the base folder of the Pack. All file references are relative to the location of the PDSC file.

\subsection pack_Cclass Software Component Cclasses

If you add a software component in the PDSC file, you have to specify a component class (CClass), component group (Cgroup),
and the component's version number (Cversion). For more information refer to \ref cp_Components.

If applicable, try to map the \b Cclass of your software component to one of the following predefined or already well
established classes listed below.  These \b Cclass names are pre-defined in the CMSIS pack using the \ref element_taxonomy "taxonomy" element.

Cclass            | Description
:-----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------
Audio             | Software components for audio processing
Board Support     | Generic interfaces for evaluation and development boards
Board Part *      | Drivers that support an external component available on an evaluation board
CMSIS             | <i>Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard</i> components
CMSIS Driver      | Unified device drivers compliant to the CMSIS-Driver specification
Compiler          | Arm Compiler software extensions
Data Exchange     | Data exchange components or data formatter, for example JSON
Device            | Startup and system setup components
Extension Board * | Drivers that support an extension boards or shield
File System*      | File drive support and file system
Graphics*         | Graphical libraries for user interfaces
IoT Client *      | IoT cloud client connectors
IoT Utility *     | IoT specific utilities, i.e. a socket interface
Network*          | Network stack using Internet protocols
RTOS*             | Real-time operating systems
Security*         | Encryption for secure communication or storage
USB*              | Universal Serial Bus stack
Utility           | Generic software utility components

Classes with a * should always be used together with a \ref Component_Bundle "bundle" to avoid conflicts with other software
components.

If you wish to standardize a new Cclass, please send an inquiry to cmsis@arm.com or raise an issue on the public 
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/issues">CMSIS GitHub development repository</a>.
