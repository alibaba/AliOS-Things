/**
\struct     ARM_NAND_DEVICE 
\details
Stores the characteristics of a NAND Flash device. This includes the page layout configuration, NAND type, 
device number (chip select), number of blocks, pages, sectors, and error correction code.

<b>Parameter for:</b>
  - \ref ARM_NAND_Initialize

*******************************************************************************************************************/

/**
\struct     ARM_NAND_ECC_INFO_x
\details 
Stores the default NAND page layout definition (with \ref spare_size and \ref spare_offset),
which contains a \b Spare area after each sector. The struct \b ARM_NAND_ECC_INFO defines the \b Spare area.

The page size is defined as the sum of \b User area plus \b Spare area. 
Each page has a small number of associated "spare" bytes (typically 1/32 of the data size) to store the Error Correction Algorithms (ECC). 

The following standard page sizes are available:

Page Size| User + Spare Area
---------|-------------------
528      |  512 +  16 bytes
2112     | 2048 +  64 bytes
4224     | 4096 + 128 bytes
8448     | 8192 + 256 bytes

NAND devices require bad block management by the driver software or by a separate controller chip. 
For example, SD cards have mechanisms that execute wear leveling and  bad block management.
The memory capacity shrinks as more blocks are marked bad.
The block size is a value specified as amount of flash pages. 

The following block sizes are available:

Block Size| Pages
----------|-------------------
  8       |   8
 16       |  16
 32       |  32
 64       |  64
128       | 128
256       | 256

\note
NAND chip manufacturers document the order in which pages can be written. 
Typically, single pages of an erase block must be written in sequential order starting from the first. Random-order writes are prohibited or unspecified.
