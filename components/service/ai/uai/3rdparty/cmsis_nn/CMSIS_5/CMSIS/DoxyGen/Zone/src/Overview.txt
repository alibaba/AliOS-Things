\b CMSIS-Zone defines methods to describe system resources and to partition these resources into multiple projects and execution areas. 
The system resources may include multiple processors, memory areas, peripherals and related interrupts. 
The system resources and partition assignments are stored in \ref zoneFormat (XML based). 

\b CMSIS-Zone includes a utility that manages these XML files. This utility:
  - displays all available system resources including memory and peripherals
  - allows to partition memory and assign resources to sub-systems.
  - supports the setup of secure, non-secure, and MPU protected execution zones with assignment of memory, peripherals, and interrupts.
  - provides a data model for generation of configuration files for tool and hardware setup.
  
The following diagram explains the development work flow when using the \b CMSIS-Zone management tool. 

\image html Partitioning_Workflow.png  "CMSIS-Zone development workflow"

The CMSIS-Zone utility reads a \ref rzone ".rzone" file that defines the overall system resources of an SoC system.
An interactive GUI supports the system partitioning. The assignments of the various partitions (also called zones)
saved in the \ref azone ".azone" file.

The combined information of resources and assignments can be exported to multiple \ref rzone ".rzone" files that represent a sub-system.
By using file templates the CMSIS-Zone utility can create tool or hardware configuration files.

It is possible to uses these steps multiple times which allows to split a complex SoC design with multiple processors into 
smaller sub-systems. For example a multi-core device can be partitioned in steps:
  - Step 1: split the multi-processor system into single processor sub-systems.
  - Step 2: create the partitions for secure and non-secure execution.
  - Step 3: configure MPU protected execution zones.

The following SoC diagram exemplifies step 1 and step 2 of this workflow.

The following sections explain: 
- \ref zoneToolUsage shows hot to use the CMSIS-Zone stand-alone tool to generate the relevant project information to be used
  in integrated development environments (IDEs).
- \ref zoneFormat (XML based) that stores system resource information and the configuration of project zones and execution zones.
- \ref GenDataModel which is used to create tool set-up files and hardware configuration files.

\page UseCases CMSIS-Zone Use Cases

\b CMSIS-Zone simplifies to manage the complexity and the configuration of modern embedded systems that frequently include
multiple processors and/or memory protection hardware. It helps to split the embedded application various projects which
creates the need to partition system resources. And it simplifies the consistent configuration of access rights across the
system, for example when using an MPU (memory protection unit).

The following section describes several uses cases that benefit from \b CMSIS-Zone.


\section UseCase_MPU MPU Protection

Focused on a single core microcontroller one might want to utilize the memory protection unit (MPU) capabilities
to segregate parts of an application. Thus the need to partition the system resources accordingly arises.

\image html mpu.png  "MPU Protection"


\section UseCase_TrustZone TrustZone Partitioning

TrustZone extensions add another degree of segregation which must be handled consistently.
In this case one has to handle MPU settings per security context and SAU configuration.

\image html trustzone.png  "TrustZone Partitioning and MPU Protection"


\section UseCase_MultiCore Multi-Core Partitioning

Beside traditional single cores asymmetric and hybrid multi-core devices contribute to increasing development complexity
for embedded systems. Having multiple cores running different parts of an application concurrently needs a well defined
resource assignment to prevent undesired misbehavior.

/**
\page zTUIMemPerRes Memory and Peripheral Resources

The available memory can be further divided into \ref zTUIMemAdd "smaller regions" that are later assigned to zones, 
for example a zone for loader and zone for application.

For memory and peripherals \ref zTUIPerProp "properties" such as access permission, privilege, and security level can be configured.
These settings can be for example used to generate source code files that configure the device at run-time.


\section zTUIMemView View memory and peripheral resources

Initially, this uses the information in the *.rzone file which defines the generic access permissions for memory and
peripherals. The CMSIS-Zone Editor shows the \b Resource \b Map of the given device:

\image html lpc55_resource_map.png

Here, you can see all resources that are available on the device.You see \b Memory, \b Peripherals, \b Cores, and \b Info
related to the resources. \ref zTGUIZoneEditor "Colored resources" are assigned to a zone.


\section zTUIMemAdd Create Memory Regions

To create a new memory region, right-click on the memory that you want to divide and select <b>Add memory region</b>:

\image html AddMemoryBlock.png

In the dialog a name derived from the parent memory region is provided. Change this region name as needed and specify the
size. In this dialog, you change permissions, privilege, or security level for the memory region. When
done, click \b Finish:

\image html NewMemoryBlockWiz.png

The new memory region is immediately shown in the zone map. Depending on the security level, you may be able to assign this
new region only to certain zones. For example, secure memory regions cannot be assigned to a non-secure zone.

\image html IRAM1_1Display.png

The information about the memory regions is stored in the \ref xml_amemory element of the *.azone file.


\section zTUIMemDel Delete Memory Regions

To delete a memory region, right-click on the memory region select <b>Delete memory region</b>:

\image html DelMemoryRegion.png


\section zTUIPerProp Resource Properties

To change the properties of a resource, such as a peripheral for example, right-click the resource and select \b Properties:

\image html res_prop.png

Then, you can set these properties:

\image html peripheral_properties.png

\b General
- \c Shared: the resource can be accessed by more than one zone
- \c Startup: locate the vector table to this region
- \c No zero init: preserve RAM content at startup
- \c DMA: enable direct memory access

\b Permissions

- \c peripheral: mark this as a peripheral
- \c read
- \c write
- \c execute

\b Privilege

- \c not specified
- \c privileged
- \c unprivileged

\b Security
- \c not specified
- \c non-secure
- \c non-secure callable
- \c secure

The information about the peripherals is stored in the \ref xml_aperipheral element of the *.azone file.

\section zTUIPerSlotConf Configure peripheral slot access rights

Peripherals can have so called slots that can be configured separately. Depending on the peripheral, the slots have different
names in the Zone Editor. For example, for DMA they are called \b Channels:

\image html dma_channel_config.png

For GPIOs, they are called \b Pins:

\image html gpio_pins_config.png

In the dialog, you can set security and privilege levels:

\image html dma_gpio_config.png

The information about the slots is stored in the \ref xml_aslot element of the *.azone file.

/**
\page zTUIZonePart Zone Partitioning

Every CMSIS-Zone project consists of one or more zones. The basic flow to create zones is as follows:
- In case of multi-core devices, create a zone for each processor.
- Then create at least one zone for each processor to be able to assign memories and peripherals. If your device contains
  Arm Cortex-M cores supporting TrustZone for Armv8-M, create a secure and a non-secure partition for each of these cores.


\section zTUICreate Create Zones

To split a multi-processor system into single-processor sub-systems, you need to create new zones. Switch to the \b Zones tab
and click the <b>Add new zone</b> button:

\image html AddNewZoneButton.png

In the new window, you need to specify a name for the zone, select the applicable core, and choose the security level
(secure/non-secure).

In the \ref zTEMusca "Musca" example, a new zone called "CM33_0" was created and attached to processor core 0 without any
security attribute (not specified):

\image html NewZoneCM33_0.png

Similarly, an additional zone called "CM33_1" was created and attached to processor core 1, without security attribute.

\b Save your settings:

\image html  SaveButton.png

\note

Adding zones only works for the currently opened \ref azone ".azone" file.
The information about the zones is stored in the \ref xml_zones element of the *.azone file.

This single processor demo application shows how to do the \ref UseCase_TrustZone. It is split into a secure and non-secure
part. Using CMSIS-Zone, it generates:
 - A header file that contains \#defines to control the various linker scatter files (and might be used in other parts of the
   application).
 - Memory protection controller (MPC) setup.
 - Peripheral protection controller (PPC) and related interrupt setup.
 - Secure attribution unit (SAU) setup.

The application itself shows how to implement calls between the secure and the non-secure part.

  - \ref zTExImport "Import" the project "Examples\LPC55S69\Zone" into the CMSIS-Zone utility
  - \ref zTProjEx "Open" the LPC55S69.azone file
  - \ref zTUIGenerate "Generate" the related output files
  
The LPC55S69.azone file of that project has the following configuration settings:
  - \ref zTUICreate "Added the zones" \c hello_world_s and \c hello_worls_ns
  - \ref zTUIMemAdd "Created the memory regions" \c CODE_NS, \c Config, \c CODE_S, \c Veneer, \c DATA_NS, and \c DATA_S
  - Selected various memory regions and peripherals for using in the different zones.

\image html lpc55_zones.png

The zones use different Flash and SRAM regions for code and data, but share Flash configuration registers. Peripherals, such
as the system and IO configuration, as well as an UART are available in the secure world only. To generate the output, click
on the \ref zTUIGenerate "Generate" button in the Zone Editor tool bar. This creates the following files in the \c ftl_gen
directory:

| Template File        | Generated File   | Description |
|:---------------------|:-----------------|:-------------|

| tzm_config_sau.c.ftl | tzm_config_sau.c | Configuration of the secure attribution unit (SAU) and the NVIC interrupt assignment. |

These files can be used in any IDE to create the final application. In the following, the usage in Arm Keil MDK is described.


\section zTELPC55_MDK Using the MDK project

The example project can be loaded, built and debugged in µVision by performing the following steps:

-# Navigate to Examples/LPC55S69/MDK
-# Open the multi-project workspace hello_world.uvmpw
-# Optional: Update the generated files by executing the copy_gen.bat scripts in hello_world_s\\mdk and hello_world_ns\\mdk
   folders.
-# Run the batch build in MDK. Both projects, hello_world_s and hello_world_ns need to be compiled in order.
-# Set hello_world_s as active project.
-# Connect the LPC55S69-EVK using a Micro-USB cable at Debug Link (P6).
-# Open <b>Options for Target - Debug</b> and make sure that the CMSIS-DAP ARMv8-M Debugger is selected and the LPC-LINK2 is
   used.
-# Optional: Open a serial terminal program (i.e. PuTTY) on the virtual serial port provided in parallel to the debugger
   (e.g. USB Serial Device). Configure the port to 115200/8N1.
-# Launch a debug session and watch the serial console output:
   \image html hello_world_output.png

\section zTELPC55_MDK_Setup MDK project setup

The multiproject workspace contains the secure \c hello_world_s project and the non-secure \c hello_world_ns project:

\image html hello_world_proj_window.png

The projects use the files generated in CMSIS-Zone as follows:

| File               | Used in | Description |
|:-------------------|:--------|:------------|
| mem_layout.h       | hello_world_s, hello_world_ns | Input for the scatter files. |
| tzm_config_mpc.c   | hello_world_s | Functions called from tzm_config.c |
| tzm_config_ppc.c   | hello_world_s | Functions called from tzm_config.c |
| tzm_config_sau.c   | hello_world_s | Functions called from tzm_config.c |

The scatter files \c hello_world_s.sct and \c hello_world_ns.sct are based on the original scatter files from NXP and are
using a preinclude to mem_layout.h to get the information about the different memory regions.

\subsection zTELPC55_hwsScatter hello_world_s.sct

As explained previously, the \#defines in \c mem_layout.h can be used to create generic scatter files that are easy
to update once changes in the CMSIS-Zone project happen. Using the \b mem_layout.h file from CMSIS-Zone, the following
scatter file is used in the secure \c hello_world project:

\code
; Use Arm compiler 6 to pre-process the scatter file and pull in the defines from the mem_layout.h file:
#! armclang -E --target=arm-arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m33 -I../ -xc

\subsection zTELPC55_TZSetup TrustZone Setup at Startup

During the system initialization, the function \b SystemInitHook is called. This is used when application specific code needs
to be called as close to the reset entry as possible. In this example, this function calls \b BOARD_InitTrustZone, which
calls the three TZM_Config_* functions:

This single processor demo application shows how to do the \ref UseCase_TrustZone. It is split into a secure and non-secure
part. Using CMSIS-Zone, it generates:
 - A header file that contains \#defines to control the various linker scatter files (and might be used in other parts of the
   application).
 - The SystemIsolation_Config.c header file that contains memory protection controller (MPC) and peripheral protection
   controller (PPC) and related interrupt setup.
 - The partition_gen.h header file that contains the secure attribution unit (SAU) setup and the NVIC configuration for secure/non-secure.

The application itself shows how to implement calls between the secure and the non-secure part.


\section zTESTM32L5_Eclipse Using the CMSIS-Zone project

  - \ref zTExImport "Import" the project "Examples\STM32L5\Zone" into the CMSIS-Zone utility
  - \ref zTProjEx "Open" the STM32L5.azone file
  - \ref zTUIGenerate "Generate" the related output files
  
The STM32L5.azone file of that project has the following configuration settings:
  - \ref zTUICreate "Added the zones" \c blinky_s and \c blinky_ns
  - \ref zTUIMemAdd "Created the memory regions" \c CODE_NS, \c CODE_S, \c Veneer, \c DATA_NS, and \c DATA_S
  - Selected various memory regions and peripherals for using in the different zones.

\image html STM32L5_zones.png

The zones use different Flash and SRAM regions for code and data, but share Flash configuration registers. Peripherals, such
as the system and IO configuration, as well as an UART are available in the secure world only. To generate the output, click
on the \ref zTUIGenerate "Generate" button in the Zone Editor tool bar. This creates the following files in the \c ftl_gen
directory:

| Template File        | Generated File   | Description |
|:---------------------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| dump_fzone.txt.ftl   | dump_fzone.txt   | Contains the complete model  |
| helper.ftlinc        | N/A              | Helper template file with FTL functions. |
| mem_layout.h.ftl     | mem_layout.h     | Header file that contains the memory region definitions, for example for the linker scatter file. |
| partition_gen.h.ftl  | partition_gen.h  | Configuration of the secure attribution unit (SAU) and the NVIC interrupt assignment. |
| SystemIsolation_Config.c.ftl | SystemIsolation_Config.c | Setup of the MPC and PPC. |
| blinky_ns.sct.ftl    | blinky_ns.sct    | Scatter file for non-secure zone. |
| blinky_s.sct.ftl     | blinky_s.sct	  | Scatter file for secure zone. |

These files can be used in any IDE to create the final application. In the following, the usage in Arm Keil MDK is described.


\section zTESTM32L5_MDK Using the MDK project

The example project can be loaded, built and debugged in µVision by performing the following steps:

-# Navigate to Examples/STM32L5/MDK
-# Open the multi-project workspace blinky.uvmpw
-# Optional: Update the generated files by executing the copy_gen.bat scripts in blinky_s\\mdk and blinky_ns\\mdk
   folders.
-# Run the batch build in MDK. Both projects, blinky_s and blinky_ns need to be compiled in order.


\section zTESTM32L5_MDK_Setup MDK project setup

The multiproject workspace contains the secure \c blinky_s project and the non-secure \c blinky_ns project:

The projects use the files generated in CMSIS-Zone as follows:

| File                       | Used in     | Description |
|:---------------------------|:------------|:------------|
| mem_layout.h       | blinky_s, blinky_ns | Input for the linker scatter files. |
| partition_gen.h            | blinky_s    | Configuration of the secure attribution unit (SAU) and the NVIC interrupt assignment. This file is included in the partition_stm32l5xx.h header file. |
| SystemIsolation_Config.c   | blinky_s    | Setup of the MPC and PPC. |
| blinky_ns.sct              | blinky_ns   | Scatter file for non-secure zone (initally based on generated file). |
| blinky_s.sct	             | blinky_s    | Scatter file for secure zone (initally based on generated file). |

\subsection zTESTM32L5_hwsScatter blinky_s.sct

As explained previously, the \#defines in \c mem_layout.h can be used to create generic scatter files that are easy
to update once changes in the CMSIS-Zone project happen. Using the \b mem_layout.h file from CMSIS-Zone, the following
scatter file is used in the secure \c blinky project, which is based on the generated scatterf file (scatter_s.sct):

\code
; Use Arm compiler 6 to pre-process the scatter file and pull in the defines from the mem_layout.h file:
#! armclang -E --target=arm-arm-none-eabi -mcpu=cortex-m33 -I../ -xc

#include "mem_layout.h"
