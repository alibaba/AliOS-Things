CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A) uses the common coding rules for CMSIS components that are documented under 
<a href="../../General/html/index.html"><b>Introduction</b></a>.


CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A) violates the following MISRA-C:2004 rules:

TO BE EVALUATED
*/
/*  
- Required Rule 8.5, object/function definition in header file.<br>
  Violated since function definitions in header files are used for function inlining'. 
   
- Advisory Rule 12.4, Side effects on right hand side of logical operator.<br>
  Violated because volatile is used for core register definitions. 
   
- Advisory Rule 14.7, Return statement before end of function.<br>
  Violated to simplify code logic. 

- Required Rule 18.4, declaration of union type or object of union type: '{...}'.<br>
  Violated since unions are used for effective representation of core registers.
   
- Advisory Rule 19.4, Disallowed definition for macro.<br>
  Violated since macros are used for assembler keywords. 
   
- Advisory Rule 19.7, Function-like macro defined.<br>
  Violated since function-like macros are used to generate more efficient code. 
   
- Advisory Rule 19.16, all preprocessing directives must be valid.<br>
  Violated to set default settings for macros.

CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A) violates the following MISRA-C:2012 rules:

TO BE EVALUATED
*/
/*
- Directive 4.9, function-like macro defined.<br>
  Violated since function-like macros are used to generate more efficient code. 
   
- Rule 1.3, multiple use of '#/##' operators in macro definition.<br>
  Violated since function-like macros are used to generate more efficient code. 
   
- Rule 11.4, conversion between a pointer and integer type.<br>
  Violated because of core register access. 
   
- Rule 11.6, cast from unsigned long to pointer.<br>
  Violated because of core register access. 
   
- Rule 13.5, side effects on right hand side of logical operator.<br>
  Violated because of shift operand is used in macros and functions. 
   
- Rule 14.4, conditional expression should have essentially Boolean type.<br>
  Violated since macros with several instructions are used.
  
- Rule 15.5, return statement before end of function.<br>
  Violated to simplify code logic. 

- Rule 20.10, '#/##' operators used.<br>
  Violated since function-like macros are used to generate more efficient code. 
   
- Rule 21.1, reserved to the compiler.<br>
  Violated since macros with leading underscores are used.
