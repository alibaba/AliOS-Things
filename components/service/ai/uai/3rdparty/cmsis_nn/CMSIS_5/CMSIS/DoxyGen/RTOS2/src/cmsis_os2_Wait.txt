The generic wait functions provide means for a time delay.

\fn osStatus_t osDelay (uint32_t ticks)
\details
The function \b osDelay waits for a time period specified in kernel \a ticks. For a value of \token{1} the system waits
until the next timer tick occurs. The actual time delay may be up to one timer tick less than specified, i.e. calling 
\c osDelay(1) right before the next system tick occurs the thread is rescheduled immediately.

The delayed thread is put into the \ref ThreadStates "BLOCKED" state and a context switch occurs immediately. The thread
is automatically put back to the \ref ThreadStates "READY" state after the given amount of ticks has elapsed. If the thread
will have the highest priority in \ref ThreadStates "READY" state it will being scheduled immediately.

Possible \ref osStatus_t return values:
 - \em osOK: the time delay is executed.
 - \em osErrorISR: \ref osDelay cannot be called from \ref CMSIS_RTOS_ISR_Calls "Interrupt Service Routines".

\note This function \b cannot be called from \ref CMSIS_RTOS_ISR_Calls "Interrupt Service Routines".

<b>Code Example</b>
\code
#include "cmsis_os2.h"
 
void Thread_1 (void *arg) {             // Thread function
  osStatus_t status;                    // capture the return status
  uint32_t   delayTime;                 // delay time in milliseconds
 
  delayTime = 1000U;                    // delay 1 second
  status = osDelay(delayTime);          // suspend thread execution
}
\endcode

/** 
\fn osStatus_t osDelayUntil (uint32_t ticks)
\details
The function \b osDelayUntil waits until an absolute time (specified in kernel \a ticks) is reached.

The corner case when the kernel tick counter overflows is handled by \b osDelayUntil. Thus it is absolutely legal
to provide a value which is lower than the current tick value, i.e. returned by \ref osKernelGetTickCount. Typically
as a user you do not have to take care about the overflow. The only limitation you have to have in mind is that the
maximum delay is limited to (2<sup>31</sup>)-1 ticks.

The delayed thread is put into the \ref ThreadStates "BLOCKED" state and a context switch occurs immediately. The thread
is automatically put back to the \ref ThreadStates "READY" state when the given time is reached. If the thread will
have the highest priority in \ref ThreadStates "READY" state it will being scheduled immediately.

Possible \ref osStatus_t return values:
 - \em osOK: the time delay is executed.
 - \em osParameter: the time cannot be handled (out of bounds).
 - \em osErrorISR: \ref osDelayUntil cannot be called from \ref CMSIS_RTOS_ISR_Calls "Interrupt Service Routines".

\note This function \b cannot be called from \ref CMSIS_RTOS_ISR_Calls "Interrupt Service Routines".

<b>Code Example</b>
\code
#include "cmsis_os2.h"
 
void Thread_1 (void *arg) {             // Thread function
  uint32_t tick;
 
  tick = osKernelGetTickCount();        // retrieve the number of system ticks
  for (;;) {
    tick += 1000U;                      // delay 1000 ticks periodically
    osDelayUntil(tick);
    // ...
  }
