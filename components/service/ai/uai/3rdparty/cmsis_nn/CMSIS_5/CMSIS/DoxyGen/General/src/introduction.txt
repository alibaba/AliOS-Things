\mainpage Introduction

The <b>CMSIS</b> is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for microcontrollers that are based on Arm&reg;
Cortex&reg; processors. The CMSIS defines generic tool interfaces and enables consistent device support. It provides simple
software interfaces to the processor and the peripherals, simplifying software re-use, reducing the learning curve for
microcontroller developers, and reducing the time to market for new devices.

The CMSIS is defined in close cooperation with various silicon and software vendors and provides a common approach to
interface to peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components. The CMSIS is intended to enable the
combination of software components from multiple middleware vendors.

\section Motivation Motivation

CMSIS has been created to help the industry in standardization. It enables consistent software layers and device support across a wide range of development tools and microcontrollers.
CMSIS is not a huge software layer that introduces overhead and does not define standard peripherals. The silicon industry can
therefore support the wide variations of Cortex-M processor-based devices with this common standard.

\image html Overview.png "CMSIS Structure"

The benefits of the CMSIS are:

 - CMSIS reduces the learning curve, development costs, and time-to-market. Developers can write software quicker through a variety of easy-to-use, standardized software interfaces.
 - Consistent software interfaces improve the software portability and re-usability. Generic software libraries and interfaces provide consistent software framework.
 - It provides interfaces for debug connectivity, debug peripheral views, software delivery, and device support to reduce time-to-market for new microcontroller deployment.
 - Being a compiler independent layer, it allows to use the compiler of your choice. Thus, it is supported by mainstream compilers.
 - It enhances program debugging with peripheral information for debuggers and ITM channels for printf-style output.
 - CMSIS is delivered in CMSIS-Pack format which enables fast software delivery, simplifies updates, and enables consistent integration into development tools.
 - CMSIS-Zone will simplify system resource and partitioning as it manages the configuration of multiple processors, memory areas, and peripherals.


\section CodingRules Coding Rules

The CMSIS uses the following essential coding rules and conventions:
 - Compliant with ANSI C (C99) and C++ (C++03).
 - Uses ANSI C standard data types defined in \b <stdint.h>.
 - Variables and parameters have a complete data type.
 - Expressions for \em \#define constants are enclosed in parenthesis.
 - Conforms to MISRA 2012 (but does not claim MISRA compliance). MISRA rule violations are documented.
          
In addition, the CMSIS recommends the following conventions for identifiers:
 - \b CAPITAL names to identify Core Registers, Peripheral Registers, and CPU Instructions.
 - \b CamelCase names to identify function names and interrupt functions.
 - \b Namespace_ prefixes avoid clashes with user identifiers and provide functional groups (i.e. for peripherals, RTOS, or DSP Library).

The CMSIS is documented within the source files with:
 \li Comments that use the C or C++ style. 
 \li <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> compliant <b>function comments</b> that provide:
    - brief function overview.
    - detailed description of the function.
    - detailed parameter explanation.
    - detailed information about return values.

Doxygen	comment example:
\verbatim
/** 
 * @brief  Enable Interrupt in NVIC Interrupt Controller
 * @param  IRQn  interrupt number that specifies the interrupt
 * @return none.
 * Enable the specified interrupt in the NVIC Interrupt Controller.
 * Other settings of the interrupt such as priority are not affected.
 */
\endverbatim


\section Validation Validation

The various components of CMSIS Version 5 are validated using mainstream compilers.  To get a diverse coverage,
Arm uses the Arm Compiler v5 (based on EDG front-end), the Arm Compiler v6 (based on LLVM front-end), and the
GCC Compiler in the various tests. For each component, the section \b "Validation" describes the scope of the 
various verifications. 

CMSIS components are compatible with a range of C and C++ language standards. The CMSIS components comply with 
the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ihi0036b/index.html">Application Binary 
Interface (ABI) for the Arm Architecture</a> (exception CMSIS-RTOS v1). This ensures C API interfaces that support 
inter-operation between various toolchains.

As CMSIS defines API interfaces and functions that scale to a wide range of processors and devices, the scope of 
the run-time test coverage is limited. However, several components are validated using dedicated test suites.

The CMSIS source code is checked for MISRA C:2012 conformance using PC-Lint. MISRA deviations are documented with
reasonable effort, however Arm does not claim MISRA compliance as there is today for example no guideline enforcement 
plan. The CMSIS source code is not checked for MISRA C++:2008 conformance as there is a risk that it is incompatible 
with C language standards, specifically warnings that may be generated by the various C compilers.
