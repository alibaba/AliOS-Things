Thread states
-------------
Threads can be in the following states:

 - \b RUNNING: The thread that is currently running is in the \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" state. Only one thread at a time can be in this
   state.
 - \b READY: Threads which are ready to run are in the \ref ThreadStates "READY" state. Once the \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" thread has terminated, or is
   \ref ThreadStates "BLOCKED", the next \ref ThreadStates "READY" thread with the highest priority becomes the \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" thread.
 - \b BLOCKED: Threads that are blocked either delayed, waiting for an event to occur or suspended are in the \ref ThreadStates "BLOCKED"
   state.
 - \b TERMINATED: When \ref osThreadTerminate is called, threads are \ref ThreadStates "TERMINATED" with resources not yet released (applies to \ref joinable_threads "joinable threads).
 - \b INACTIVE: Threads that are not created or have been terminated with all resources released are in the \ref ThreadStates "INACTIVE" state.
 
\image html "ThreadStatus.png" "Thread State and State Transitions"


A CMSIS-RTOS assumes that threads are scheduled as shown in the figure <b>Thread State and State Transitions</b>. The thread
states change as follows:
 - A thread is created using the function \ref osThreadNew. This puts the thread into the \ref ThreadStates "READY" or \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" state
   (depending on the thread priority).
 - CMSIS-RTOS is preemptive. The active thread with the highest priority becomes the \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" thread provided it does not
   wait for any event. The initial priority of a thread is defined with the \ref osThreadAttr_t but may be changed during
   execution using the function \ref osThreadSetPriority.
 - The \ref ThreadStates "RUNNING" thread transfers into the \ref ThreadStates "BLOCKED" state when it is delayed, waiting for an event or suspended.
 - Active threads can be terminated any time using the function \ref osThreadTerminate. Threads can terminate also by just
   returning from the thread function. Threads that are terminated are in the \ref ThreadStates "INACTIVE" state and typically do not consume
   any dynamic memory resources. 

\note 
Refer to \ref threadConfig for RTX5 configuration options.

Thread Examples
===============
The following examples show various scenarios to create threads:
 
<b>Example 1 - Create a simple thread</b> 

Create a thread out of the function thread1 using all default values for thread attributes and memory from the
\ref GlobalMemoryPool.
 
\code
__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  // ...
  for (;;) {}
}
 
int main (void) {
  osKernelInitialize();
  ;
  osThreadNew(thread1, NULL, NULL);     // Create thread with default settings
  ;
  osKernelStart(); 
}
\endcode

<b>Example 2 - Create thread with stack non-default stack size</b>
 
Similar to the simple thread all attributes are default. The stack is dynamically allocated from the \ref GlobalMemoryPool
 
\ref osThreadAttr_t.stack_size is used to pass the stack size in Bytes to osThreadNew.

\code
__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  // ...
  for (;;) {}
}
 
const osThreadAttr_t thread1_attr = {
  .stack_size = 1024                            // Create the thread stack with a size of 1024 bytes
};
 
int main (void) {
  ;  
  osThreadNew(thread1, NULL, &thread1_attr);    // Create thread with custom sized stack memory
  ;
}
\endcode

<b>Example 3 - Create thread with statically allocated stack</b>
 
Similar to the simple thread all attributes are default. The stack is statically allocated using the \c uint64_t array
\c thread1_stk_1. This allocates 64*8 Bytes (=512 Bytes) with an alignment of 8 Bytes (mandatory for Cortex-M stack memory). 
 
\ref osThreadAttr_t.stack_mem holds a pointer to the stacks lowest address. 
 
\ref osThreadAttr_t.stack_size is used to pass the stack size in Bytes to osThreadNew.

\code
__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  // ...
  for (;;) {}
}
 
static uint64_t thread1_stk_1[64];
 
const osThreadAttr_t thread1_attr = {
  .stack_mem  = &thread1_stk_1[0],
  .stack_size = sizeof(thread1_stk_1)
};
 
int main (void) {
  ;  
  osThreadNew(thread1, NULL, &thread1_attr);    // Create thread with statically allocated stack memory
  ;
}
\endcode

<b>Example 4 - Thread with statically allocated task control block</b>
 
Typically this method is chosen together with a statically allocated stack as shown in Example 2. 
\code 
#include "cmsis_os2.h"
 
//include rtx_os.h for types of RTX objects
#include "rtx_os.h"

__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  // ...
  for (;;) {}
}
 
static osRtxThread_t thread1_tcb;
 
const osThreadAttr_t thread1_attr = {
  .cb_mem  = &thread1_tcb,
  .cb_size = sizeof(thread1_tcb),
};
 
int main (void) {
  ;
  osThreadNew(thread1, NULL, &thread1_attr);    // Create thread with custom tcb memory
  ;
}
\endcode

<b>Example 5 - Create thread with a different priority</b> 
 
The default priority of RTX is \ref osPriorityNormal. Often you want to run a task with a higher or lower priority. Using the
\ref osThreadAttr_t control structure you can set any initial priority required.

\code
__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  // ...
  for (;;) {}
}
 
const osThreadAttr_t thread1_attr = {
  .priority = osPriorityHigh                    //Set initial thread priority to high   
};
 
int main (void) {
  ;
  osThreadNew(thread1, NULL, &thread1_attr);
  ;
}
\endcode

\anchor joinable_threads
<b>Example 6 - Joinable threads</b>
 
In this example a master thread creates four threads with the \ref osThreadJoinable attribute. These will do some work and
return using the \ref osThreadExit call after finished. \ref osThreadJoin is used to synchronize the thread termination. 


\code 
__NO_RETURN void worker (void *argument) {
  ; // work a lot on data[] 
  osDelay(1000U);
  osThreadExit();
}
 
__NO_RETURN void thread1 (void *argument) {
  osThreadAttr_t worker_attr;
  osThreadId_t worker_ids[4];
  uint8_t data[4][10];

  memset(&worker_attr, 0, sizeof(worker_attr));
  worker_attr.attr_bits = osThreadJoinable;
 
  worker_ids[0] = osThreadNew(worker, &data[0][0], &worker_attr);
  worker_ids[1] = osThreadNew(worker, &data[1][0], &worker_attr);
  worker_ids[2] = osThreadNew(worker, &data[2][0], &worker_attr);
  worker_ids[3] = osThreadNew(worker, &data[3][0], &worker_attr);
 
  osThreadJoin(worker_ids[0]);
  osThreadJoin(worker_ids[1]);
  osThreadJoin(worker_ids[2]);
  osThreadJoin(worker_ids[3]);
 
  osThreadExit(); 
}
\endcode

/**
\enum osPriority_t
\details

The \b osPriority_t value specifies the priority for a thread. The default thread priority should be \a osPriorityNormal.
If an active thread becomes ready that has a higher priority than the currently running thread then a thread switch occurs
immediately. The system continues executing the thread with the higher priority.

To prevent from a priority inversion, a CMSIS-RTOS compliant OS may optionally implement a <b>priority inheritance</b>
method. A priority inversion occurs when a high priority thread is waiting for a resource or event that is controlled by a
thread with a lower priority. Thus causing the high priority thread potentially beeing blocked forever by another thread
with lower priority. To come over this issue the low priority thread controlling the resource should be treated as having
the higher priority until it releases the resource.

\note Priority inheritance only applies to mutexes.

\var osPriority_t::osPriorityIdle
\details This lowest priority should not be used for any other thread. 

\var osPriority_t::osPriorityISR

/**
\var osThreadAttr_t::attr_bits
\details
The following bit masks can be used to set options:
 - \ref osThreadDetached : create thread in a detached mode (default).
 - \ref osThreadJoinable : create thread in \ref joinable_threads "joinable mode".  

\var osThreadAttr_t::cb_mem
\details
Pointer to a memory for the thread control block object. Refer to \ref StaticObjectMemory for more information.

Default: \token{NULL} to use \ref CMSIS_RTOS_MemoryMgmt_Automatic for the thread control block.

\var osThreadAttr_t::cb_size
\details
The size (in bytes) of memory block passed with \ref cb_mem. For RTX, the minimum value is defined with \ref osRtxThreadCbSize (higher values are permitted).

Default: \token{0} as the default is no memory provided with \ref cb_mem.

\var osThreadAttr_t::name
\details
Pointer to a constant string with a human readable name (displayed during debugging) of the thread object.

Default: \token{NULL} no name specified (debugger may display function name instead).

\var osThreadAttr_t::priority
\details
Specifies the initial thread priority with a value from #osPriority_t.

Default: \token{osPriorityNormal}.

\var osThreadAttr_t::reserved
\details
Reserved for future use.

\var osThreadAttr_t::stack_mem
\details
Pointer to a memory location for the thread stack (64-bit aligned). 

Default: \token{NULL} to allocate stack from a fixed-size memory pool using \ref ThreadStack.

\var osThreadAttr_t::stack_size
\details
The size (in bytes) of the stack specified by \ref stack_mem.

Default: \token{0} as the default is no memory provided with \ref stack_mem.

/**
\cond (ARMv8M)
*/

\var osThreadAttr_t::tz_module
\details
TrustZone Thread Context Management Identifier to allocate context memory for threads. The RTOS kernel that runs in
non-secure state calls the interface functions defined by the header file TZ_context.h. Can safely be set to zero
for threads not using secure calls at all. 
See <a href="../../Core/html/group__context__trustzone__functions.html">TrustZone RTOS Context Management</a>.

Default: \token{0} not thread context specified.
