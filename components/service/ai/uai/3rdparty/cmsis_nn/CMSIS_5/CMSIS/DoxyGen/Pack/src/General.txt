<b>CMSIS-Pack</b> describes a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board
support. The XML-based package description (PDSC) file describes the content of a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack"
(file collection) that includes:
 -  Source code, header files, and software libraries
 -  Documentation and source code templates
 -  Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms
 -  Example projects

The complete file collection along with the PDSC file is shipped in ZIP-format (renamed to *.pack). The PDSC file is designed
for software development environments and describes the user and device relevant context for the files supplied within such
a pack file.

The CMSIS-Pack system solves several problems: 

- It provides meta-data of files that relate to a software component. All files that belong to a software component can be
  identified and information about the original provider is preserved. 
- It enables consistent software component upgrade and identifies incompatible configuration files that may be part of the
  user application. 
- Software component providers can specify the interfaces and relationship to other software components.
- The meta-data of a software component can include dependency information for toolchains, devices, and processors which
  simplifies the integration into application programs.

After installing a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack", all included software components are available to the development
tools. \ref cp_Components "Software components" are a collection of source modules, header and configuration files as well as
libraries. Packs containing software components can also include \ref cp_Examples and \ref cp_CodeTemplates.

The \subpage pack_revisionHistory lists the main changes between versions.


\section SWPackVariants Software Pack Use Cases

A pack can be used for multiple purposes:
 
\image html SPVariants_small.png  "Software Pack Use Cases"

The figure above shows the following use cases for Software Packs:
  - <b>Device Family Pack (DFP):</b> contains CMSIS system/startup files, drivers, and flash algorithms for a microcontroller
    device family.
  - <b>CMSIS Software Pack:</b> contains the generic CMSIS components (CORE, DSP Library, and RTOS implementation) supplied by Arm.
  - <b>Middleware Pack:</b> contains software components belonging to a middleware (such as source code or libraries).
  - <b>Board Support Pack (BSP):</b> contains documentation, schematics, and drivers for a certain development board.
  - <b>In-house Software Packs:</b> usually contain software components that can be distributed within a
    company or engineering group.
  
\note A Software Pack can address multiple use cases at the same time!

The following sections provide more information:

 - In the \ref cp_Packs, learn the basics and the required steps for creating a pack.
 - \ref cp_SWComponents shows how to start a pack from scratch.
 - \ref createPack_DFP describes how to enable device support in a DFP.
 - \ref createPackBoard covers the creation of Board Support Packs (BSPs).
 - \ref pack_Example explains the available example pack in more detail.
 - Learn how to \ref createPackPublish.
 - \ref createPackUtil are available that are useful during the creation of a pack.
 - \ref packFormat describes all XML elements that can be used in a PDSC file.
 - \ref configWizard can be used to create GUI-like elements in development tools for configuration files.
 - \ref flashAlgorithm algorithms are used to erase or download applications to Flash devices.
 - \ref coresight_setup allows to create tool-agnostic debug and trace configurations
 - \ref cpdsc_pg is a environment/tool independent definition of a software project. This helps to create only one set of
   example projects that can be used by many different tool vendors.
 - \ref packIndexFile are used to generate a catalog of available packs.
