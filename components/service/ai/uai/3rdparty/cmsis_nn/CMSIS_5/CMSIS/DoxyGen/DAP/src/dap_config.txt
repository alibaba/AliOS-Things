CMSIS-DAP Firmware runs on Debug Units with a Cortex-M microcontroller.

The CMSIS-DAP Firmware is designed to execute on a Debug Unit that is using a Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M3, or Cortex-M4 
processor-based microcontroller. 

The following steps describe how to change the microcontroller in the CMSIS-DAP Firmware project:

1. Open in the uVision IDE the project file <b>.\\Firmware\\MyDebugUnit\\CMSIS_DAP.uvproj</b>.
2. Open the <b>Project - Options - Device</b> dialog and select the microcontroller of the new Debug Unit.
3. In the <b>Project Window</b> replace the files that belong to the group <b>Startup Code</b> with the relevant files for the new device.
4. Optionally you may modify the project file <b>Target</b> name and the file <b>Abstract.txt</b> to reflect the new Debug Unit.

\image html "MDK_Device.png" "Select the microcontroller"

In MDK Version 5 changing the microcontroller should bring in already the relevant software components for the new target. However, depending on the
availability you may need to replace some components with custom implementations.

/**
\defgroup DAP_ConfigUSB_gr Configure USB Peripheral
\ingroup DAP_Config_gr
@{
CMSIS-DAP Firmware communicates via an USB interface to host computer.
The USB communication is implemented via MDK middleware components that access the USB peripheral of the microcontroller.

The CMSIS-DAP Firmware is able to communicate with the host computer using one of the following USB classes:
  - \ref USBHID (Human Interface Device) does not require any USB driver installation.
  - \ref WinUSB provides higher speed communication but may require an *.inf file for USB installation. 

For the USB interface it is important to provide correct configuration information for the USB Peripheral as described in this section.

The following steps describe how to change and configure the USB peripheral in the CMSIS-DAP Firmware project:

1. In the <b>Project Window</b>, the group <b>USB</b> contains USB interface with the relevant configuration files.
2. Open the file <b>usb_config_0.c</b> in the editor and select <b>Configuration Wizard</b> as edit mode; then change the following settings:
  - <b>USB Device 0 - High-speed</b>: enable this option only for a high-speed USB peripheral; disable for full-speed USB.
  - Update <b>Device Settings - Vendor ID</b> which is provided by the <a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/vendor/" target="_blank">USB Implementers Forum</a>.
  - Update <b>Device Settings - Product ID</b> to provide a unique identification for the Debug Unit.
  - Update <b>Device Settings - Device Release Number</b> to indicate the revision of the adaptation.
  - Update <b>String Settings - Manufacturer String</b> to reflect the vendor of the Debug Unit. This setting should match the <b>Vendor ID</b>.
  - Update <b>String Settings - Product String</b> to indicate the Debug Unit. Note that "CMSIS-DAP" must be part of that string to allow identification by debuggers (or part of interface string for USB composite device).
  - Optionally each Debug Unit may provide a unique <b>Serial Number String</b>. If the <b>String Settings - Serial Number String</b> is not provided, only one Debug Unit can be connected at the same time to a host computer since it is impossible to identify multiple Debug Units.

  
\note 
  - The USB Device setting high-speed / full-speed USB must be reflected in the \b DAP_config.h file as described under \ref DAP_Config_gr.
  - The <b>String Settings - Product String</b> must contain "CMSIS-DAP" somewhere in the string. This is used by the debuggers to identify a CMSIS-DAP compliant Debug Unit that is connected to a host computer.

\page USBHID Communication via USB HID

CMSIS-DAP with V1 configuration uses USB HID and is therefore compatible with previous versions of CMSIS-DAP.  There is no modification at the debugger required as all the additions are fully upward compatible. To 
configure CMSIS-DAP for V1 interface, add to the compiler options the \#define DAP_FW_V1 as shown below: 

<br>
\image html "MDK_DAP_FW_V1.png" "Compiler CMSIS-DAP Firmware for USB HID interface"

The CMSIS-DAP Firmware can be also part of a USB composite device. If this case, the <b>HID Interface String</b> must contain the sub-string <b>CMSIS-DAP</b>.
The <b>HID Interface String</b> is configured in the file USBD_Config_HID_0.h under the category <b>Human Interface Device Class Settings</b>.

<br>
\image html "MDK_USB_HID.png" "Adapt CMSIS-DAP to the USB HID class"



\page WinUSB Communication via WinUSB

CMSIS-DAP with default V2 configuration uses WinUSB and is therefore faster. Optionally support for streaming SWO trace is provided via an additional USB endpoint.

The WinUSB configuration requires custom class support with the interface setting – Class Code: 0xFF (Vendor specific), Subclass: 0x00, Protocol code: 0x00.
Depending on the configuration it uses the following USB endpoints which should be configured in the interface descriptor in this order:
  - Endpoint 1: Bulk Out – used for commands received from host PC.
  - Endpoint 2: Bulk In – used for responses send to host PC.
  - Endpoint 3: Bulk In (optional) – used for streaming SWO trace (if enabled with \ref SWO_STREAM).

To identify a CMSIS-DAP V2 configuration by debuggers the following WinUSB GUID must be used:
\code
{CDB3B5AD-293B-4663-AA36-1AAE46463776}
\endcode
The picture below shows the configuration of the USB custom class. 

\image html "MDK_USB_Custom.png" "Adapt CMSIS-DAP to the WinUSB class"

<b>USB Driver and *.inf file</b>
<br><br>
Windows 8 and Windows 10 does not require a WinUSB driver provided that the USB firmware stack supports Microsoft descriptors. 
CMSIS-DAP v2 device should be configured as WCID (Windows Compatible ID) device which provides extra information to a Windows system
to facilitate automated driver installation. 
<br><br>
For Windows 7, the CMSIS-DAP v2 device will install automatically if PC is connected to the Internet and Device Installation Settings 
of PC are set to automatically download and install drivers for devices. Automatically installed device will be seen in 
Device Manager under Universal Serial Bus devices as WinUsb Device
<br><br>
If no Internet connection is available or you want device to show with different name under Device Manager you should 
provide an .inf file and sign it to generate .cat files. More information is available from Microsoft under the topic  
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd919238(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank">Steps for Signing a Device Driver Package</a>.
<br><br>

The following CMSIS_DAP_v2.inf file should be provided for an Windows 7 host PC.

The CMSIS-DAP Firmware is programmed into Flash ROM of a Debug Unit.

Once the CMSIS-DAP Firmware is configured it needs to be programmed into the Flash
ROM of the new Debug Unit. MDK provides already Flash algorithms for many Cortex-M based microcontrollers
and therefore you may use the Flash programming facilities that are provide in uVision.

Once Flash programming is configured you may use the uVision menu item <b>Flash - Download</b>.

\brief Optional you may add a CMSIS-Driver USART to interface to SWO.
\details
A CMSIS-Driver USART can be used to capture the trace output on the SWO pin using a UART RX input on the
microcontroller. To use a UART for SWO capturing, it is required to set the \#define SWO_UART to 1.
Refer to \ref DAP_Config_Debug_gr for more information.

The actual USART Driver instance is defined in the source file <b>SWO.c</b> using the \#define USART_PORT.
You may change this define with a compiler option.
