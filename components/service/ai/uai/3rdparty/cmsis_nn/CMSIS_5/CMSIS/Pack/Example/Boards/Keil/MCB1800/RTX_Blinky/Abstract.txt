The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC1857' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1800'
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 180 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor 
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of 
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The BLINKY example program is available for several targets:

  LPC1857 Flash:       configured for on-chip Flash
                       Valid Flash Signature is created with ElfDwT tool.
                       See "Options for Target" - "User"


  LPC1857 RAM:         runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                       (may be used for target debugging)
