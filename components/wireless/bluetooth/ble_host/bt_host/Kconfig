	help
	  HCI-based stack with optional host & controller parts and an
	  HCI driver in between.

config BT_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom"
	help
	  Select a custom, non-HCI based stack. If you're not sure what
	  this is, you probably want the HCI-based stack instead.

	help
	  Supports Bluetooth ICs using SPI as the communication protocol.
	  HCI packets are sent and received as single Byte transfers,
	  prepended after a known header.  Headers may vary per device, so
	  additional platform specific knowledge may need to be added as
	  devices are.

config BT_USERCHAN
	bool "HCI User Channel based driver"
	help
	  This driver provides access to the local Linux host's Bluetooth
	  adapter using a User Channel HCI socket to the Linux kernel. It
	  is only intended to be used with the native POSIX build of Zephyr.
	  The Bluetooth adapter must be powered off in order for Zephyr to
	  be able to use it.

config BT_NO_DRIVER
	bool "No default HCI driver"
	help
	  This is intended for unit tests where no internal driver
	  should be selected.

	help
	  Enable support for throttling ACL buffers from the controller
	  to the host. This is particularly useful when the host and
	  controller are on separate cores since it ensures that we do
	  not run out of incoming ACL buffers.
