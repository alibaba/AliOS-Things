2. Read and complete the application form.
3. Prepare the electronic materials required in the form.
4. Compress [AliOS Things certification application form](http://alios-things.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/AliOSThings/AliOS%20Things%20%E8%AE%A4%E8%AF%81%E6%8F%90%E4%BA%A4%E7%94%B3%E8%AF%B7%E8%A1%A8.xlsm) and all the electronic materials required, and name it as `AliOS Things certification application-{chip model}.zip`
