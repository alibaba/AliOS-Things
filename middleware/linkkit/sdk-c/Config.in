config MQTT_COMM_ENABLED
    bool "FEATURE_MQTT_COMM_ENABLED"
    default y
    help
        Establish persistent connection with AliCloud via MQTT-based protocol

        Switching to "y" leads to building MQTT related implementation into SDK and MQTT_COMM_ENABLED included into CFLAGS
        Switching to "n" seldom happens unless you're connecting to AliCloud via CoAP/HTTP channel

        help
            Directly connect MQTT server without perform HTTP authenticate to another HTTP server ahead

            Switching to "y" leads to connect MQTT server directly and MQTT_DIRECT included into CFLAGS
            Switching to "n" leads to legacy authenticate mode: connnect HTTP server first, then connect MQTT server afterwards

config OTA_ENABLED
    bool "FEATURE_OTA_ENABLED"
    default y

    help
        OTA (Over The Air) means upgrade device's firmware or configuration remotely via Internet

        Switching to "y" leads to providing such capability via IOT_OTA_XXX() APIs

config DEVICE_MODEL_ENABLED

    default y
    help
        Enable providing Thing-Model-Management/Alink-Protocol encapulation in SDK

        Switching to "y" leads to SDK being able to interpret JSON payload in MQTT channel, which also called "Advanced Version Protocol"
        Those capabilities are provided via IOT_Linkkit_XXX() APIs or being_deprecated linkkit_xxx() + linkkit_gateway_xxx() APIs

            Enable providing Thing-Model related functions via being_deprecated/old/obsoleted APIs
            They are named as linkkit_xxx() or linkkit_gateway_xxx(), declared in linkkit_export.h and linkkit_gateway_export.h

            Switching to "y" leads to SDK providing APIs in linkkit_export.h + linkkit_gateway_export.h
            Switching to "n" leads to SDK providing APIs in iot_export_linkkit.h

        Establish non-persistent connection with AliCloud via CoAP-based protocol

        Switching to "y" leads to building CoAP related implementation into SDK and COAP_COMM_ENABLED included into CFLAGS
        Switching to "n" leads to keeping CoAP-based cloud connection implementations out of SDK
